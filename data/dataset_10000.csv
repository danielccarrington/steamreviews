3735,10,Counter-Strike,"A classic. That is the best way i can describe this game, but if you only played CSGO or even CSS and then you decide to go on a nostalgia trip to test the game, prepare to feel like you are in a very alien environment. The 2 hours that i tried, yes tried, to play the game were filled with learning the controls, adapt to the different recoil and aiming system in geral and then dying over and over again by the more experienced players  I recommend the game if you want to expand your gaming history horizons and give it a try, but you can expect frustration and rage. Its a piece of gaming history and it should be preserved as such, but new gamers will probably never get it.",1,0

But that is not true, Only America fight Japan and Russia fight Germans. Where are the Arabians?? But no I also enjoyed the game mode 'Nazi Zombies' I thought that this was very realistic, even more so than Gary Oldman playing a Russian (I joke ha ha) but no it was very good.

To get the whole story you have to consume peoples memories, which is a very daunting task just to know what the hell is going. I wish the character was more engaging. They also used the same cutscene three different times in game.(where he is talking to soldier and helicopters attack in backround).

Yeah new games are pretty bad and they are not even trying to make it better. However this game... Modern Warfare series man. Story , characters , gameplay ( I always liked COD's gameplay ) , music all of them are magnificent. Even after all this time game aged pretty well. I am talking about campaign. Sadly in multiplayer there are so many hackers sometimes game is literally unplayable because of that :c , still worth it even just for the campaign 9.2/10.     S:Do you have the DSM?

Yeah buy it, it worth it =)",1,0
29322,10180,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"Like all other COD games other than the multiplayer, the best part is the campaign. I must say that the group at Infinity Ward has really outdone themselves on newest COD campaigns. The campaign itself is so real, and so dramatic that it makes you love each character in your squad. Jumping back and forth between members of the CIA, 141, and the Army Rangers the overall plot is very exciting and also easy to follow. Many times the tables will turn to situations you never saw coming. ",1,0

In all seriousness this game lacks an Anti Cheat now, the multiplayer lacks an resemblance of balance and 90% of people who play this now are doing so because of nostalgia. The singleplayer campaign lacks depth and comes off decidedly 'Meh' it's neither good nor awful.

33047,102500,Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning™,"At first, I did not like this game that much because I saw too many settings copied from The Elder Scroll V. Skyrim is the best RPG game I've played ever so I thought of such behaviors as stealing.  After playing a couple of hours, I tried to restart to feeling the game and did not skip the dialogues though I considered them not touching. Slowing down my step, I found out that the style of view is also amazing in another way and the moves of characters are quite smooth.  The open world and wide range of items must be along with a well RPG game, and Amalur does not lack anyone of them. It combines many good settings of lots of games. It has its flaws for sure, and I'll definitely choose Skyrim when these two games are at the same price. This is still good game worth being recomended.  I really enjoy playing this game and it's just a beginning of my path.",1,1

34183,102500,Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning™,"This is a very well made and refined game, but I just find it hard to enjoy with so much better RPG's readily available in the same price range. The game is extremely repetitive and the 'revolutionary combat' is nothing more then countless hours of button mashing. The NPC's were not engaging or unique and offered poor and repetitive quests. Now don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad game, but for the 20$ price tag I would have expected much more out of this game. For a game that competes against both Dark Souls and Skyrim, this game falls short in almost every aspect. However the one thing this game does have going for it is it's reliability, it has very smooth frame rates and has never crashed on me. All in all, spend your hard earned cash on Dark souls, Skyrim or even Mount and Blade, not this generic button masher.",-1,0

The graphics are beautiful. The combat is excellently done and engaging. The RPG aspects are somewhat standard, nothing especially outstanding about them. Lip Synching leaves a lot to be desired.

I like the graphics and the style of the game takes me back to games that I loved like the Monkey Island story, but as a modern game it falls short.  I think the main problem is the format. The puzzles that you can build with a point and click interface are either dead simple or illogical. You end up knowing what the problem is, but struggle with how the game wants you to solve the problem.

I reccomend this game to hardcore gamers. If you aren't good with hard survival games that can be confusing at the beggining if no videos or people tell you anything about it. AND IT IS NOT ANYTHING LIKE MINECRAFT SO STOP SAYING THAT! Here are some tips throughout the game: First, get wood and make houses so that you and NPCs can live in them. For it to be a valid house, you need to have solid blocks, no holes in the wall, a table and chair, and a background wall. Next, go mining and exploring. Don't forget to bring torches, NIGHT AND CAVES ARE REALLY DARK WITHOUT LIGHT. You may find cool gadgets that you can equip in your inventory, also, you should make some armor. Next, fight bosses such as the eye of cthulu and get even better gear. You can go and fight skeletron at the end of the world and have access into the dungeon. Keep playing the game and progressing further. Next, go to the bottom of the world, make a long, straight, pathway and then throw a guide voodoo doll into lava and fight the wall of flesh. You will now be in hardmode which makes a new biome and every enemy is buffed incredibley. I will let you continue from there on your own. Have fun :)",1,1

71230,105600,Terraria,"This game is really great for alot of reasons. You may create characters and take them into any world you choose with their inventories saved. When you travel around in a world you come across different terrain like snow, jungle, desert, etc. and the background changes too. There are so many places to explore and there's alot of enemies in the game too as well as bosses that are really fun to kill. Building a village and having NPC's like a merchant or an arms-dealer move in is quite satisfying. The crafting system is so complex and the item list in this game is gigantic, I'm not exaggerating when I say there are so many damn items to craft or find in this game.

98852,105600,Terraria,"Terraria is good, but not great.  Don't go thinking i'm saying this since i play Starbound.  The game is good, items are good, textures and music are good, but the game itself? eh, don't waste your money. Get Starbound. Way better (Again, not because i played it first. If you think that's why, don't.).  The controls are confusing no matter what you set them to, you have to look at your inventory just to exit out, you cant exit the game using that big red x at the top, you start out with crappy weapons and mining is slow, you cant see AT ALL at night unless you have a torch, you cant defend yourself from monsters that are flying at the beginning, takes forever just to respawn, you cant do much at first, you don't see how much of a block you mined, the pickaxe is a better weapon than the sword, and the biomes make no sense. there is literally a block inbetween biomes.  If you want this game, go ahead. It's fine, but i would recommend Starbound (YOU SERIOUSLY THINK I WROTE THIS SINCE I PLAYED STARBOUND FIRST!? WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!?)",-1,0

101858,105600,Terraria,"TL;DR : Hours apon hours of fun is something to look forward to in Terraria.  Some call it a 'minecraft sidescroller' but it's much more. There is already over a 1000 items to find or crate and the game is STILL being updated. The game is well balanced and there are still many public and private servers for you to join (though I would recommend NOT going on a public server that aren't for new characters until you have played well into hardcore mode because the free items will ruin the game, almost like having unlimited diamond armor in minecraft right from the start.   There are tons of bosses and every world will be different from the last, even with material variation and alternitive biomes, meaning some armors and Items have yet to be discovered by you until you make a whole new world.  I bought this game way back and at 2 bucks or whatever it is during the summer sale is a STEAL for what you're getting. Even 15 bucks is still a really good deal for it. I have close to 1000 hours and wouldnt be shocked if I ended with more than 1000 by the time the second game comes out.   Only problem I have with the game is that for my PC I cant have youtube or a Twitch stream running while playing like other games for some reason. However the game is fun enough that you dont have to have other entertainment while you play.  IMO: 10/10",1,0
102435,105600,Terraria,"If you are a hardcore Minecraft fan, this may be a game you enjoy. I found the tutorial too fast-paced and the game play frustratingly boring. I would recommend you skip this game and get Starbound if you want to try 2D minecraft-esque games.",-1,0

106665,105600,Terraria,"Final Rating: 5/10 Closing Statements: This game was fun for the first couple of hours, but I gradually got bored of it and never really picked it back up again. If you're bored or you're a diehard minecraft fan then you ahead and pick it up. Yet, I really don't recommend this game because there are many other games out there that are more worthy or your attention.   A lot of people say that this game is the 2-D Minecraft and I think that's a fair analysis of the game. You gather resources during the day and get attacked by various 'creatures' at night. There's obviously no true storyline that comes across in this game.   'You survive, get better resources, build better equipment, and defeat more and more powerful monsters.' There is also a way to play online with your friends via building a client-side server.   Pros: Fairly balanced level of difficulty Semi-Open World Many different Items you can craft  Magic! Online play with your friends Build a house for NPC's and they'll be your best friend  Cons: The use of a wiki might be required I was never that much of the game mechanics. The process of creating items seemed more difficult than it had to be.  No 'developed' storyline Dig Down and Down, and Down, and Down :/  Note: I know there are a lot of people that love this game, but I quite simply couldn't get into it. I found the game very boring and 'rage quitingly' difficult at times.  Compared to this game, Minecraft takes the cake.  Save your money",-1,0

Predator is a fantastic race to play as, the amount of weapons at your disposal and not to mention stealth makes you a force to be reckoned with, Then we have Marines. Basically similar to Doom but one good thing about the Marine is that the Marine is by the far the most intense out of three species and gives off a survival-horror Aliens feel.

159655,107100,Bastion,"While the artist style of the game is unique, the game as a whole is fairly weak.  The combat system is overly simplistic and consists solely of attack-dodge-repeat mechanics; minimalism is great, but this is barren. The variety of weapons should make the combat more interesting, but they don't because the combat system is too simple. No matter which weapon you pick, the difference will only be how far away you stand from the enemies.  The design and introduction rate of the weapons are lousy as well: you bounce from weapon to weapon quickly and upgrading weapons is pointless. Sure, you can activate idols, which makes weapon upgrades a bit more useful, but you're still stuck in the same poorly designed combat system.  The story is one of the worst I've had the displeasure of following. It's a trope-filled story narrated in a discontinuous manner with character building ripped out. The writers failed to make me care about the world or any of the characters. For imagery, think of the story as macaroni necklace: it's strung together, but not cohesive.  The 'narrative' expects you to be okay with the plot suddenly having certain elements; the turning point for me is when the line 'We became fast friends' is mentioned. This is the kind of inept story telling I'd expect of inexperienced writers, of high-school students. You can't simply say a bunch of things: there has to be connectivity between story points. Why did they become fast friends? The calamity isn't a good reason, as the direction the plot goes afterward shows. Am I to infer all of the character building, relationships and details that are not provided to me? That's not my job; the writers must do their part.  If you're looking for depth, subtlety and cohesion in a story, I'd send you to Spec Ops: The Line, not to Bastion.  The dreams are bits and pieces of back-story for each character, and they at the very least tie the macaroni necklaces into a giant ball. This is still a failing on the game's part with blame lying squarely on the writers and designers. Why weren't these things part of the main story? Why do they never come up via character interactions? All these elements that bring the main strand of story closer to something legitimate are tucked away in optional iterative-round fights. This comes off as poor design, and ultimately looks and feels lazy. It's squirrelled away; swept under the rug.  What passes for story in this game feels like bullet points for the beginning of a story idea.  To say I'm disappointed in Bastion is an understatement; it's completely forgettable.",-1,0

The narration provided over the gameplay fits perfectly in with the experience, and the voice actor does an impossibly amazing job. The art style is also beautiful, with everything being drawn by hand. Sound is great also, with all weapons sounding like they have some real weight to them, and the environments and enemies have beautiful ambience and barks respectively. Gameplay is amazing as well, taking a top down view and letting you go nuts with two of any weapon you choose, along with a special ability. Difficulty is handled really interestingly with an 'idol' system that doesn't just increase the health and damage of the enemies, but gives them additional abilities as well that keep you on your toes. The challenge is there, the style is there, it's all there. This is without a doubt one of my favorite games of all time.",1,0

When you complete the game, a New Game+ mode is unlocked which lets you replay the game with items earned in the earlier playthrough. Various other mini challenges are also available which rewards players with weapon upgrades.  Downsides, the movement speed of the main character felt too slow for my tastes as i find myself rolling all over the place hoping to get to places faster.  Some weapons are also no fun to use (like the army carbine where you have to wait too long to line up a shot).

185364,107410,Arma 3,"One of the buggiest and most unfinished game I've ever played.  Starts game on medium settings, 20 fps, sets to ultra, 50 fps. That's also a very bad framerate for having 2 r9 280x  Firstly, none of the sound is working. Sound is working everywhere else, except for Arma 3.  Then I got into a multiplayer game, which takes a few restarts btw. I couldn't find a single server so I had to end up just joining my friend through Steam and it worked.  Then I got into a server and after waiting for all textures to load, I noticed the bad framerate.  Then we started driving around for a while and even the driving is really bugged. If I start going forward, I can't stop going forward and the same for going backwards. Then I decided to go out of it. I got thrown out high up in the air and landed so I died.  Also, a small little thing, the cursor is still visible. It flies over all monitors, but the game doesn't tab out or click anywhere, so no big deal, just a little bit annoying...  One of the buggiest games I've played in a while. :/",-1,1

The netcode is a DISASTER! Servers can barely handle more than 50 people and even then it's super laggy, rubber-banding and warping all over the place.

The addition of achievements has added some of the fun into playing with bots back into the game, even for long time players like me.  Unfortunately, the lastest update has virtually broken the game. Not because they changed the design or moved where things are, but because the client won't manage to stay connected for more than a single game, if you can manage to get the server to stay connected that long.

222355,108710,Alan Wake,"One of the few 'pure action' (rather than action-hybrid) games which I like. Alan Wake's psychological thriller/horror theme sets this game apart from most action games. It isn't a survival-horror game per se, although it can certainly be tense at times.   The graphics can be very impressive, particularly the lighting effects.  However the most incredible aspect of this game is the story; the plot is utterly enthralling and holds your interest from the start to the end. Twists come frequently, and frankly this is one of the most thoroughly entertaining storylines I've ever experienced in a game.  Recommended for anyone who loves story-driven games, action games, or games with psychological horror themes.   Pros: + Very pretty light effects + Simple but enjoyable core gameplay mechanics + Electrifying, enthralling and very well-written plot that grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go  Cons: - Its not the deepest of games, mechanically speaking",1,0

Alan Wake can offer a good challenge for those who seek one if you decide to bump up the difficulty.  There comes a point in the game it may seem repetitive and enemies just cycle non-stop. Making it switch to fun to not-so-fun. It could definitely use more of a dynamic battle sequence.

232437,11150,Sherlock Holmes: The Secret of the Silver Earring,"Can I say this game is good? Perhaps, but with certain conditions. Firstly, it's FAR better than 'Holmes &amp; the Mystery of the Mummy' and 'Holmes &amp; the Hound of Baskerville', in terms of quality, character and logical conclusion. Secondly, it does challenge players usings its puzzles and quizzes. Now, challenge is good for these types of games, but sometimes, the answers don't quite make sense. Maybe it's just me being daft? Yeah, probably. But the game isn't particularly long, in terms of quantity of puzzles, but they are certainly sharp enough to be considered adequate.   So, graphics are better then previous games. But the cut scenes and navigation can still be stuttery. Like, whenever you want to talk to people, you have to approach them from a certain angle, and rotate yourself awkwardly.  And if you want to walk somewhere, sometimes layering can be strange, and you walk through chairs and all. But, that's not the point of a puzzle game, I suppose.  Navigation is once again an odd concern. The game  must  be played in third person. Not only that, you have to click somewhere to make Holmes walk there, and double click to make him run (you can only run when outside or nobody is around). Particularly painful, especially in the forest part of the game. But still, a puzzle in itself perhaps.  Along with puzzles are the quizzes. Basically, at the end of each in-game day, you get quizzed on everything you've collected in the day, from the clues you find, to the dialogue of people you talk to. Mind you that  answers are not exclusively restricted to that day's resources  but can actually include information as far back as the first day. This means you'll need to  remember what all evidence contains, and link it with any new evidence found . Painful, especially if you can't remember things in pristine detail, like me. At least there's a walkthrough on GameBoomers.  There are various characters that are involved, some providing more information than others. Lestrade seems particularly friendly toward Holmes though.  Interface isn't too bad, seeing as you can read your notes and do a puzzle  simultaneously . Very useful, and the best part is that  the puzzle saves your progress , unlike 'Holmes &amp; the Mystery of the Mummy', so you can go and find more clues, come back and finish the fight.  I find that the explanation at the end is quite complicated, and twist-inducing.  Would've been better if it didn't break my computer every few minutes.  Like, literally. I'd finish the credits or walk into a room, and I'd just get a black screen. Maybe a hardware fault regarding specs, but it ran fine for most of the game. But otherwise, it was alright for a game of its state.  I'll hand this one a respective 7/10. Not the best, but certainly not the worst. It turns out Frogwares actually changes the character models for Holmes and Watson in the later games, so at least Holmes looks like he's had enough sleep.",1,0

275641,113420,Fallen Earth,"Character customization is decent. Concept is good. Default keybinds are not intuitive, and make switching weapons clunky - especially since there's no way to draw two one-handed weapons at once. Skill/AP system looks shiny enough, but there is no apparent in-game info on what's most beneficial/what should be focused on - ask on the help channel, and you get pointed to the wiki site. I'd rather be able to play the game than spend all day doing research on a wiki. Combat is awkward, with targeting being off to one side of the character rather than in front, and the hitboxes seem off sometimes. Running away/kiting doesn't seem to be a viable option, as melee enemies are able to hit you from several feet away - you'll just die tired.  Found the game on a top 20 MMO list, decided to give it a try. Was excited to find there might be an RP element, but never saw any of that in-game - might be difficult as a F2P player to RP anyway, since there's no access to public channels?

277508,11450,Overlord,"Do you ever wanted to be the bad guy? Do you ever admired the Dark Lord, looking badass, destroying world and killing those pesky heroes? Well, then, this game is for you! Without further delay, lets sink into the fantastic (and sarcastic) world of Overlord!  The 'bad guy' game market is severelly limited. Everywhere we are feeded with either Goody McGood heroes, fighting to save the world or with shallow concept of being gray and developing our character the way we want to (shallow being either ♥♥♥♥ing rainbows knight in shining armor or baby killing maniac). You wont see that here. Instead, we are evil from the start. And that's what making this game fun.  Gameplay is really basic sadly. We are the Overlord. We need to rebuild empire. But Overlord doesn't just go around killing stuff, oh no. He have his minions for that. So we are running around with bunch of our Imps, killing things, collecting stuff to upgrade our tower and (of course) doing some fairly easy puzzles. The style is kinda like Zelda. We need some item or other thing to advance further, we collect it, defeat the boss with that, go to another area, rince and repeat.   Graphics are really beatiful. This game aged well, giving nice vibe even so long after the golden release. Locations are colorful and alive yet distinct, there are things moving everywhere, light effects are well made. The olny thing I can really dissaprove of are the overall sugar-like appearances of every single location, but the game have it's (gigantic dose) of humour, and exaggeration pays a big role in that.  Music is on par with graphics. Really exaggerated, yet well made and distinct. Sounds are great. Every single detal from random people dialogs to battle sounds are great.   Story is great. We are the Overlord, taking over the world yet again. At our path there will be much obstacles, including corrupted heroes, lack of resources and other natural or unnatural calamities. Narration is smooth and plot twists are well done. We even have the pleasure of having a wife here, and Overlord is not your average multihour RPG.  Bad things? Well, for starters all our work is done by minions. I won't say its technically bad, but our Overlord can't do crap. Its kind of stupid, we are the antihero of this world. The other thing, because the game is strongly influenced by Zelda franchise, we can't really talk about open world RPG or exploration all that much. Oh, we can go to the previous locations to loot additional stuff with our new powers (it's unattainable otherwise, the easiest example would be Imp Pillars in the water, we can't get them, until we get Blue Imps), but we need to go from point A to B on a series of semi-linear locations in order to progress with the story. Also our Overlord can't be developed all that much. More minions, stronger armor and weapon and minion types. Sadly that's all.   Well, if you we're spending all nights in Dungeon Keeper, this game is for you. It have great sense of humor (and a bit of self awareness), nice graphics, enjoyable and easy gameplay, and, of course, you play as the bad guy. Its a good piece, althou technically not a RPG, and sadly, kind of short. But hey, its Zelda on crack, so it can't be all that bad! I would recommend this game to anyone from new to experienced players. Go! Conquer the world, Overlord!  Zawisza out.",1,0

Random map is probably the most fun (skirmish mode).  + Nice graphics, nice sounds, great gameplay + Learning curve, your first play will likely result in defeat, even on easy + Loads of nations, 17 in total including 8 European nations + Realistic fighting: reload/aiming times  - Unbalanced nations, for example Sioux are able to create strong cavalry units in no time in fast, large amounts - Sound missing, FIX: press enter, type qwe hit enter again (will reveal whole map though)  - Sometimes the game switches back to fast mode, even if it was set on slow mode, but can easily be changed in options  Random map tips:   1 Don't forget to put strong melee units in your buildings, or you might have your base taken over 2 You can stop large fast enemy groups by forming a defensive line around your base, forcing the enemy to battle with you (instead of them going around your army to your base) 3 Scroll down the top right menu in random map menu for more options such as peace time (really handy if you want to build up large armies/prepare defenses) 4 The more you construct of the same buildings, the more expensive they will get.

Live requires me to log on, and remains in full screen mode, so it's impossible to read my password on my password manager.  4.) Social club serves no purpose at all. 5.)

Even if you do go no restriction, it locks to 30fps on the highest setting even though my computer can go well and above that. Even on lower settings, cutscenes have immense screen tearing while the game itself ran somewhat smoothly.  ------  A review for game itself, it age pretty poorly and the controls are mediocre (using a controller for this).

If I didn't get this game on sale in a package with the other GTA games I would have asked for a refund. It is NOT Steam's fault though as they are more or less a digital version of a video game store for the most part. Yeah they have their own products, but most of these games are provided as a digital release from the publisher and from what I have heard, Rockstar is notorious about not caring about it's customers or it's games after a few months to a year. Is that true about Rockstar, I have no idea, but from what I have been seeing it does seem that way.   In the end, all I can say is use extreme caution when buying this game itself.

317308,12220,Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City,"★★☆☆☆  GTA:SA was an amazing game for its time, this sequel was a disappointment.  I had GTA4 on PS3, it was an awful game. Terrible writing. Bland graphics. An awful city made up of the same 1 monotone building copy/pasted 100 times down the same streets, with no variety whatsoever. The gameplay itself was clunky and boring, with countless bugs breaking the game on a regular basis.   I got this DLC pack since I didn't have either, and wanted to see if the game was any better on PC. The stories here are a bit better. Everything else is just as bad or worse. The controls hardly qualify as functional on either platform.   I also hear that this game no longer even works on PC, because of service shutdowns and/or Windows10 compatibility, but haven't tried it in a long while, so can't confirm.",-1,0

319161,12480,9th Company - Roots of Terror,"Liked the movie it was made after and I like the game too, as it conveys a lot of that dark humour and tension from the movie (btw, you can see the whole movie with subtitles on YouTube)  The game takes your company of Soviet rookies through their tour of duty in Afghanistan, by making it through a bunch of missions. You can only take a certain number of them on a mission, so it's good to rotate guys a bit, to give all the experience they need for the hard final battles. It has nice pre-battle squad equipment management options and off-map close support options, which get better if you complete missions well. Interesting and rather difficult missions also teach you a lot about history and the nature of guerilla warfare in Afghanistan.  It's possibly a bit too short so not all that much replay value, but if you play through it once every couple of years it'll be fresh enough. ;)",1,0

The game is mission-based and although each mission has several objectives, only the primary ones are needed to complete the mission. How you complete your mission is very open-ended and there are often multiple paths and ways of doing things. You can be as ruthless as you want, deciding whether or not to kill people (or simply avoid them entirely).  Despite having been released in 2005, the game still looks impressive. The controls are complex and some people might have a learning curve to get over, but please stick with it. Unlike lots of more recent games, Chaos Theory allows you to not only save (both manual and quick saves) whenever and wherever you want, but name them as well.

I needed to let the game run on a single core to make it run better but it still has slowdowns from time to time. - You need to configure gamepad controls yourself, there are no gamepad controls in the menu. - Changing the volume of my pc changed nothing about the volume of the game. - I kept fighting against the camera. My mouse barely moves it.   EDIT: I made the game work by using an older PC and using the gamepad for controls instead of mouse + keyboard (still no gamepad controls in menu).  The platforming is very enjoyable, unfortunately the environment doesn't change too much. I think the pacing is also a bit off even though the game is pretty short. You get banter between characters but there are many, many rooms between story progression that I feel could've been cut out.

Ignore everything below, as that is written from the POV of someone who has played and completed nearly every game in the entire series, and went back and played this one now on PC. The series was one of the best and most revolutionary ones there were. I wish I could experience them for the first time again.*****  As someone who has played every single Assasin's Creed from start to finish, going back and playing this game was painful in terms of the mechanics, camera angles, repetitiveness.   The main story-line is still good although repeptitive, and I did enjoy the nostalgia seeing how the series got started in terms of the pieces of eden, abstergo, and desmond.  However you are assigned to assassinate a total of 9 people, and before you can kill one of them, you must complete at least 2-3 mini tasks.  There are only 3 different mini tasks in the entire game: Pickpocket a random citizen for info, talk to an informant and complete his task, and beat up a random preacher/well-know citizen to get info from them. You do this NINE times. You literally pickpocket, escort/run through city, and fist fight a citizen a total of 25-27 times, and then assasinate a target. (9 main kills, 2-3 mini tasks before each one).  Once again want to emphasize if you've never played the series, please get this and play it through, as you're starting one of the best and most successful game franchises of all time.

Many of them, myself included, felt betrayed and cheated. If I could have gotten my money back I would have. I am not saying DOW 2 is a bad game. It is just not what I would play or pay for and to call it an RTS was misleading. Reading more about Relic I think it was an intentianal money grab (my opinion). The developers should have called this Warhammer 40k (insert something other than Dawn of War 2) but they chose not to.

I think this game got great potential and I played it a lot during its initial release on Windows. However I got to give this a thumbs down because it seems like it never got patched and there are a couple of things that I find broken.  Issues: - Does not run out of the box on some Linux distros because of bad practise when defining LD_PRELOAD_ADDITIONS - The matchmaking in the game mode The Last Stand does not work. It will detect possible games but will not match you with them. This is one of the things I remember as broken since the initial release, the time to find a game in The Last Stand. However in Linux I could leave this on for 20 minutes without finding a game, even though the game presents for me that there are games available and people to match with (this is presented by the UI).  Improvements: - Options to change default keybindings. I think this is a problem with the game in general. You cannot change fundamental keybindings like the map navigation, you are stuck with the arrow keys. - No key to reset the camera angle. This is another fundamental feature that you would expect out of a game like this.

What I did was to follow two different suggestions found here:  Steam Community post   and here:  Youtube Video   Step 1: Download the Bin64 files from the first link then extract and copy the entire folder into the Crysis program directory. Rename the Bin32 folder found in the same directory to Bin32.BAK. Then rename the Bin64 folder you just copied to Bin32.  Step 2: From the second link, download the Crysis.exe file found in the video description. In the newly renamed Bin32 folder (the one that was Bin64), rename the Crysis.exe file to Crysis.BAK. Next, copy the Crysis.exe file you downloaded from the Youtube link into the same Bin32 folder.  Step 3: While still in the Bin32 folder, right-click on the Crysis.exe file you just copied and select Properties. In the Compatibility tab, check the box next to 'Run this program in compatibility mode for:' and then select 'Windows Vista (Service Pack 2)' from the drop down menu. Click Apply then OK.

Crysis is touted for its amazing graphics, and that's probably the ONLY thing this game has going for it. Especially for the time it was released it was indeed groundbreaking graphics wise, but other than that, Crysis is derivative, and repetitive. It's mindless shooting at its finest. The gameplay is simplistic, story is stupid, and cutscenes are horrendous. Bad voice acting, often voice is out of sync with craracters actions making certain things look plain stupid. Only i nthe end of the game does the story pick up and offer a somewhat interesting twist, but nothign we havent seen before. Crysis is shooting the same enemies in different environments with same weapons, again, and again and again, without anyhting new actually ever happening.

A very pretty game. - Pretty and ambient soundtrack. - Depth of interaction and choices makes this game feel very alive. - Character creation is decent and can give you a very different feel for your own personal Shepard. - Voice acting is very well done.   Cons: - Side quests are extremely repetitive. Made from a mix and match system of all the same buildings and enemies. - Sometimes areas of the game make it east to die and difficult to save. Having to repeat a 20 minute sequence several times can be frustrating. - Hacking and interacting with various objects all use the same 'frogger' type mini-game and can become rather tedious.

394364,17460,Mass Effect (2007),"First off, I have played this game multiple times over, primarily on PS3 before I got a proper PC. I loved every moment of this game, from the story missions to the side quests and tiny details such as random speech and small tasks.   Pros: 1. Satisfactory combat mechanics 2. In-depth story (like seriously in depth) 3. Dynamic story, centred around your actions, even the slightly different speech options 4. Can be polar opposites in terms of behaviour, total ♥♥♥♥ or space messiah 5. Thorough customisation system, both in the character and the weaponry 6. Highly replayable 7. AI fairly intelligent  8. Nice textures, after some tweaking in some cases (covered in CONS) 9. Does a good job getting you emotionally invested 10. Romance system, entirely optional 11. Great lore, the background and the universe is extremely interesting 12. Most maps are fun and varied 13. Fantastic voice acting, I cannot cound how many NPC's have voices and are interactable. However Male Shepard's voice can get rather boring after a while, as it is a little monotone and becomes more noticeable as the game progresses  Cons: 1.Mako handles like ♥♥♥♥ 2.Open world expanses (Around 1 square mile of terrain) seem carbon copied and quite barren 3.In some cases, in mine anyway, the texture quality was extremely poor, mainly noticeable on NPC's clothes and Shepard's clothes. Relatively easy fix though, go into the BIOengine.ini and turn up the TextureLODSettings. Walkthrough here:  http://forums.steampowered.com  4. Graphical glitches, only on Noveria (Central base and rift station until you get to Benezia) and Ilos (entire duration), all characters become weird blocky black siloheuttes, to fix open console and input 'viewmode unlit' which should fix the problem, when these areas are through, input 'viewmode lit' and this returns you back to normal settings 5. Crap inventory system, items are not categorised and are all in one screen, making it difficult to find a particular item 6. Citadel is too large, and too confusing to get around, as well as the fact some places are not distinct enough as most of the buildings and business are in greyish white buildings with no signage. The Asari Consort's place is supposedly distinct according to one elcor diplomat but when found it is the most unoticeable place I have ever seen, the only indication is the Asari receptionist inside, wearing a pink gown and can only be seen from one angle which you will not be approaching from. 7.Not much weapon variation, i think there is around 2 models, and only 3 colours (grey, red and a brownish grey w/ an orange stripe) 8. Game totally finishes after the final mission and send you right back to the main menu, no chance to continue exploring afterwards, so finish any side quests that need wrapping up before you do the final mission (For reference, the final mission starts when you command the ship to go to Ilos, so do the side missions before doing that) 9. I enjoyed the music, but it can get repetative and annoying after a while  I would seriously recommend anyone thinking of buying this to buy it, especially if you are an RPG fan. If you aren't possibly buy it when it is on sale, as this game is not like your standard RPG, and you may find you like it. I wasn't an RPGfan when I bought this game many moons ago, but it introduced me into the world of RPG's and now I love them, but the penultimate for me will always be the Mass Effect series",1,0

Sadly though the game is not difficult at all, I have managed to beat it a few times over the past few months without even trying to be honest, and with that, the length of the game is very short as well.  The art style is nice, and I really appreciate the sounds here. I especially enjoy the noises your character makes when you fall and break into little pieces of paper. Pttshhhh!

It felt refreshing and great to play as a young woman and I think many women will feel the same, she is fierce, witty and most of all, capable.  Not only is her world and mind extremely beautiful, you will find many allies and really enjoy the combat. The world is so visually stunning and well thought trough. Her world is lurking with secrets and absurd creatures, and it is up to you to figure all this crazy mindboggling stuff out.  If you're looking for a game were absurd and crazy comes into mind this is really the game for you. The combat is simple but yet very satisfying and easy to enjoy and learn.

The original Far cry at the time it appeared was a masterpiece that I enjoyed immensely. It was absolutely gorgeous, engaging to play and overall it just felt good. Far cry number two however falls short or gets you annoyed in several different parts. First of all when I started playing, I wasn't expecting it to be an Africa based awful driving simulator. There's way too much driving around in an open world that has little less activities to do than to shoot at everyone because everyone is extremely mad at you for existing. The world feels empty. How the AI works and behaves is questionable and because the enemy guys' bare chests are actually kevlar or something even sturdier you find yourself asking is this game really a game worth playing. I would go as far to say that it isn't. Too much repetition, too much boring driving and too much forced confrontations with foes that merely want to slow your progress in an annoying way (destroying the engine of your car so you have to stop and fix it).   It isn't all bad however. It brings up some interesting points in the story off how cruel a civil war truly is, the greed of mankind and all sorts of nasty things. The game can look pretty freaking beautiful at times especially on daytime. Some of the guns feel pretty nice to shoot until they jam or break completely and won't shoot anymore. I did finish the game and at the end I felt both relief and contentment.   There are just a lot more and better FPS games to be had than this. Don't waste your time. The predecessor of Far Cry 2 was a better game and so is the successor as well. Better to spend your money on something completely different.

The movement seems almost limpish as if everyone was limping which just breaks the feel to the game. The action is mediocre wether you're using melee attacks to take out an enemy silently or the shooting aspect where you need to be in the over-the-shoulder view (iron sight) if you want to see the crosshairs. Then there's the cover system which is hit or miss and just like in Gears of War; you will die quickly if you're not behind it.

447065,200510,XCOM: Enemy Unknown,"Overhyped, mediocre and repetitive.  I really liked it's predecessors and I had to give it a try. After beating it on on Ironman Classic this game leaves much to be desired and the overall gameplay experience suffered from poor gameplay mechanics and balance.  The story is non-existent, but that's not a problem. You don't play X-Com for the story. Aliens invade the earth, finished. Some base building and research is involved, but those are really basic. Three research tiers of weapons that all do the same thing with advanced weapons having a chance to destroy cover. Some auxiliary gadgets. A mobile weapon platform that is never used at all, because it blocks a squad slot (and thus a soldier from gaining experience). A selection of armour with useful abilities like flight and stealth. The base itself has the basic set of generators, research and production facilities and some other required buildings. After you figured out the pattern there is little to no deviation in the building process.  It's all about the tactical gameplay and that's where it lacks the most. You have a cover based tactical approach. Cover reduces enemie's accuracy. The biggest problem with it is that the variance is really high. It makes sense with a sniper weapon, firing a high risk / reward shot. But your big guy with the heavy machine gun shoots once for x points of damage, meaning he can completely miss and in the process making combat results completely random. It would help tremendously if the heavy machine gun wouldn't behave like a sniper and instead shoot x times for a lower amount of damage for a more secure source of damage. This can get really frustrating when you have a truck sized alien hiding behind a postbox and neither getting a scratch while under heavy fire.  The usual tactical approach is to remove the cover by spamming as many grenades and rockets as you can. This is where the repitition starts. You just cheese your way through, because every other tactical option becomes too risky. You coulld flank, but that carries the risk of getting shot and your elite soldier screaming like a little man-girl infecting everyone else with his panic attack and wiping your whole squad. The only other option is to snipe everything down with a super powered sniper. This problem is further enhanced by the bad graphical representation of what you can and cannot do. There is no way to see the real line of sight of your soldiers and you only know if you can take a shot at the enemy from a certain position after moving there. This wouldn't be a problem if you could reliably take out cover without spamming explosives (those are limited), but you can only target the enemies itself. (there is an ability in the game for the heavy solder later on that can be used in such a way)  This is alleviated a little bit during the first frew rounds. Different map layouts and objectives promote differendtapproaches. But the map pool is so small that the tactical approach takes a back seat and memorizing enemy positions becomes more important. The game has many more and smaller problems, but those are a direct result of the poor gameplay mechanics.  Overall the game felt tedious and completely random. I'm dissapointed. With minor fixes every problem could be solved making the game more enjoyable overall. I have to admit I don't understand the huge praise this game gets from all sources. It's dumbed down tactical experience doesn't hold up to it's predecessors. While they offered at least as cheesy approaches as this instance they nonetheless provided more options. Graphics aren't really great even for 2012. Economic aspects aren't fleshed out. And the game gets repetitive after ~3-5 hours, depending on the difficulty setting. It might be the Game of Thrones aspect of not knowing who bites the dust next for whatever bs reason. Like shooting his own cover because apparently rocket launchers use the DnD rules of engagement and have a 1 in 10 chance to completely miss the target and hit anything else in that general direction. And of course everyone started to panic. ",-1,0

463551,200710,Torchlight II,"If you liked Diablo 2, you'll love this game. While the story and composition are almost exactly identical to D2, there are a few changes that I absolutely loved. I found the skills very approachable, you can make your build as simple or as complex as you want, and most builds are effective. You can no longer upgrade gems the same way, so you don't need to feel compelled to collect and keep all the gems. They added a limited ability to respec your character, so you have a few levels to play around with skill choices, which I found useful. However, the most notable change (for me) is the independent treasure drops. There is no longer a mad scramble for the best loot if you play multiplayer. You can take all the loot you see, which made multiplayer infinitely more enjoyable for me.",1,0
463572,200710,Torchlight II,"Torchlight 2 is one of the best RPGs I've played. It's more unique than most because you start with a pet instead of having to buy one or find one. Not to mention the pets can sell stuff for you. The storyline is really great and, after finishing it and playing Torchlight 1, it is a direct sequel from the first game. Even if you didn't play the first one, the story will make sense. The storyline is not very deep however, the story is a great but shallow one. Exploration is fairly fun (nowhere near as fun as Skyrim though). Another great thing is that that it has a Steam Workshop AND comes with its own modding program!",1,0

477640,200900,Cave Story+,Absolutely fantastic retro style arcade game where everything seems balanced to perfection. The sense of adventure will draw you to see what's in the next section and keep going on and on. You can choose the original version's graphics or the smoother new graphics which aren't very different. The game looks gorgeous in both modes and retains its wacky atmosphere. The rest is platforming and shooting heaven. Plenty of exploration and boss fights sprinkled pretty evenly throughout the levels.   Highly recommended. An indie classic.,1,0

482973,201490,Airline Tycoon 2,"While I kind like the artstyle of this game (brings me back to the good old days of playing Theme Park World), it's sadly the only thing I liked about this game besides one other thing. I'm quite into sim games in general, but this game really did not cut it for me.  In this game you play a cartoonish airline manager (there are a few to choose from, each with their own special trait like getting better deals at on-flight meals) and you have to be the most succesful one: aka be the most profitable. You buy planes for your fleet and customize to your liking, balancing airplane quality, fly range, maintenance and transport size. You can also buy plance from the scrapyard, which is a nice touch but I doubt beneficial due to very high maintenance and the planes often being too outdated (yes, planes technology evolves in this game). You have to get your crew together (balancing skills versus salary), arrange stuff for you planes, etc.  But in the end there is one mayor issue: the game is TERRIBLY slow. You (and your competitors) advance at the speed of a snail... While this does resemble real life better, it sadly just isn't fun. This combined with a very steep learning curve as the tutorial just doesn't cut it, causing me to feed that I really have no idea what I'm doing nor what I ought to do. And that's bad for a sim game. You should have the feeling that your decision matters and you should get feedback on the consequences of you choices. But sadly, it takes too long to get that feedback and if easy to miss it as the gains are often very small.  This game disappointed me. If your time is valuable to you, try some other game instead of this one. Or be willing to ask google to help you play this game, because without it you'll surely fail :(",-1,0

489573,201810,Wolfenstein: The New Order,"Very linear, the one 'choice' changes almost nothing except which character gives commentary at a few points.

Mixing the two so much almost never really works very well.  Too many forced scenes where your character is knocked out, captured, imprisoned, etc.   Extremely gory just for the sake of shock value to make the bad guy seem like more of a bad guy.   Gameplay is OK. Guns handle a bite crappy. There's a forced reduction in mouse move speed when aiming down the sights and you can't disable it. You have to spend a ton of time scavenging for armor pieces and health which begins to feel pretty tedious.   It's a theme park ride on rails, and the story is extremely depressing and cheesy.

Oh, well there may be a problem here.  Look I love Jurassic Park and this one is kind of cool. The nods to the 1993 film, the minimal cross-over, (although to be honest I wanted more,) the plot and the action are all good. The plot is actually pretty much what I thought 'The Lost World' would be when I was a kid and went to see that. The dialogue seems kind of hammy at first but admittedly gives the feel of early-90s Spielberg. But while some of the problem-solving puzzles are fun enough, having an action scene being basically ruined by being forced to hit keys at various times just isn't fun and doesn't make you feel any more involved in the action. You kind of just wish you had the option of just sitting back and watching it all unfold instead.  This felt like Jurassic Park and in that it was good. It just wasn't fun to play",1,0

The gunplay worked well for the parts that had it, there are again perks you can rank up to help with damage/focus etc. I found the movement of the character and the driving to be very good, and again some of the best I've come across in this type of game.

Sleeping Dogs is set in Hong Kong and revolves around the various Triad gangs residing there. It makes for a brilliant change of pace from the typical American Gang norm. Sleeping Dogs does tend toward the more serious end of the genre as opposed to something like Saints Row, but if you like Drama, you're in for a treat!  + Great setting - Hong Kong at night in the rain looks incredible, and the hawkers everywhere add to the atmosphere + Solid story + Interesting and diverse characters and motivations + Great melee combat system  - Bad PC port has bugs and general oddities - Core graphics are pretty dated although the lighting is top notch (looks amazing with the neon lights illuminating the city in the rain) - Poor performance, even on relatively high end system - Controls aren't the most responsive, and while you do get used to them, they aren't in common usage or particularly intuitive (right-click as the action button?!?!!?)   7/10   Overall a very worthwhile game with a compelling storyline, characters and environment.

The gameplay is much smoother this time around to make the fights feel more fluid and energetic, this does detract from the eerie atmosphere somewhat, with Alan feeling more powerful than ever (to be fair he would be pretty battle hardened by now though) and the enemies being easier to take down it is hard to feel overwhelmed, which does detract from the horror side of things. Storywise the game features a less intricate plot - The general overview is the doppelganger of Alan created from the ending of the first game - Mr. Scratch - is on the lose and attempting to destroy everything important to Alan and he must stop him before that happens.

Depending on the weather, one could opt to be professional and keep things quiet or go on a Sterling Archer-esque rampage.   Absolution, however, decides to take that agency away and puts you in the uncomfortably tighter suit of a restrictive narrative, much like your mother did when you were flower boy at your Uncle Gerald's wedding. Unfortunately, the aforementioned narrative is done in disappointingly poor taste, and Absolution's linear nature does not lend itself well to multiple replays.   Filled with ghoulish, hideous caricatures which are supposed to pass some semblance of human beings, Absolution catapults you into the grungy abyss of a metaphorical (and at one point literal) sex dungeon.   It remains a competent stealth-action game and there's certainly some fun to be had if you're truly, desperately bored...but try as you might, you can't wash the smell of grindhouse out long after you've left.",-1,1

520991,203140,Hitman: Absolution,"STATICKINETICS TLDR Review:  Apart from better graphics, Absolution is a failure and regression in the Hitman series. Instead of the open, dynamic and interesting gameplay of Blood Money or Contracts, Absolution feels 'on-the-rails' especially in the numerous missions that actually force the player into a stealth gameplay style. One of the defining features of the Hitman series was the ability to create your own playstyle and plan out your mission accordingly. Sadly that is just not the case in many Absolution missions, and the introduction of bullet-time 'instinct' is a pitiful attempt to patch up the gaping wound that is the clunky and unsatisfying gunplay of Absolution. Finally, the game's storyline feels entirely out of place and awkward as well as flatly cliche. The atmosphere (as opposed to the 2004 'Contracts') lacks continuity and feels very 2-dimensional, underscored by the absence of Jesper Kyd's wonderful compositions that gave the original Hitman games their character and soul.",-1,1

Looks nice, but that's the only aspect in which this is an improvement over Blood Money.",-1,0
522201,203140,Hitman: Absolution,"I write this review with a heavy heart. I was very excited for H:A, I even shelled out extra to preorder it. But I just uninstalled it after only a couple hours of gameplay, because I found myself just.... not wanting to play it.  I've played through all of the other hitman games, without ever looking for help online. For a good hitman game, get Hitman Bood Money (HBM). It's this one's predecessor and is much, much better in just about every way.  Pros: Fantastic graphics, I like the scoring system, too.  Cons:  There are so many. Let's start with the controls.   The controls suffer from horrible feature bloat. They added all sorts of ♥♥♥♥ to the game that I wuold rather not have.   For example, cover-based combat: 'Sneak' and 'take cover' use the same button, but when you 'take cover' you can't really move around much. There were many, many times where I wanted to sneak around, but I ended up getting stuck to a wall or couch or whatever and unable to move away from it because I had taken cover behind it. This gets aggravating really, really fast.  In HBM, to climb over an obstacle, you walk towards it, and possibly hit 'use'. Simple enough. In HA, you instead walk up to the object, take cover behind it, hold forward, hit use, and you vault over it. Way more cumbersome, way more annoying.  Combat is especially bad. They replaced hand combat with this screwed up quicktime events sequence. In order to knock someone out you have to hit 3 fast quicktime events, otherwise you go back to the start of the combat and do it again. You can do a loop of the first two quicktime events for literally forever. It just keeps looping Furthermore, if you happened to go within a few feet of a hostile, it goes into this quicktime combat mode and there is NO WAY OUT OF IT except to hit all the quicktime events. You can't even turn and run.  Normally, in a shooter, you'll have a 'look down sights' button to improve your accuracy. In HA they have two buttons. There's a 'look down sights' button and a 'REALLY REALLY LOOK DOWN SIGHTS I MEAN IT THIS TIME' button that you push after you push the first button.  Saving is no longer possible. Instead, there are automatic checkpoints in certain places, and levels are split into smaller, atomic parts. No longer do you have a big building to explore. You have tiny individual sections with no consequences between them.  Bins are EVERYWHERE for easy body disposal. Too easy.  There are cutscenes galore with no way to skip them  Health regenerates. Also too easy.  No map. No closing doors. No closing doors! It used to be so important for hiding ♥♥♥♥ to keep it behind a closed door, but now you have to wait like an idiot for the door to swing shut on its own.  Disguises no longer really work at all. You have to use this 'instinct' 'feature' that some poor programmer wasted his time on and some game designer thought was a good idea.  It seems to me that every change in this game makes sneaking a PAIN IN THE ♥♥♥ and running and gunning the clear, obvious choice.   Usually, in HBM, a level takes about 20-40 minutes to scope out, and another 20 to execute perfectly, no kills, never getting spotted, not leaving any evidence. The levels in this are way too easy. Example: There's a Chinatown level. Before you go in, a guy says 'He's got a nice car'. You walk into the map, walk straight, you get to a nice car. Next to it? A bomb.. Set off the car alarm, wait for target to walk up, set off bomb, target dead level over. Took me 5 minutes. I had already beaten the level in 2 minutes beforehand by going in and shooting him in the head and running out.... H'es right there in the middle and you can do that.   It completely throws away everything that made the previous games so much fun. There's no need to practice, learn routines,. There's no emergent behavior. There's no puzzle. It's dumbed down and a disappointment.  1/5",-1,0

The story wasn't really that much of a deal. I read into the story of the previous games, but it didn't help me much. It didn't feel like the story was important in the game.  The gameplay is a challenge. Once you get into it, you have the urge to do it perfect. It's not always fun to wait and wait until certain events happen, but the results are always stunning. You can kill someone in so many ways.. amazing!  What bothered me in the end, is that the last mission took me 5 minutes and was childs play compared to previous missions. Shouldn't the last one be the most exciting one? I think the mission were you need to kill    the wrestler or the nuns    were way more exciting and especially more challenging! ",1,0
524331,203140,Hitman: Absolution,"Hitman: Absolution is a very pretty looking third person stealth action shooter.  The game is very well put together and features unique gameplay that I have not seen in other games. The game lets you do things your way, but rewards you more for being stealthy. The whole idea is you are an assassin that is unseen or unheard as you take down your targets.  The storyline for this game is very good and kept me interested until the very end. You follow the assassin Agent 47 as he rebels against his own agency to protect a girl from many different enemies. The game is very stylized and features a lot of humor. The graphics are very very good looking and visually interesting.  The only con I really had with this game was its length. The campaign felt very short.

531723,203160,Tomb Raider,"In my 25+ years gaming I've never actually played a Tomb Raider game. Of course the series has only been around for 17 of those years but that's besides the point. So seeing as the new 2013 Tomb Raider is complete reboot storywise it seemed like a reasonable place to start and a great start it was too. First let mention the graphics which are top quality and run smoothly even on my aging GTX260. However there is of course a lot more to a good game than great graphics. This is the story of Lara Croft's first adventure after being shipwrecked on a strange island filled with a bunch of crazy culists and ancient artifacts. It's an interesting story as you discover more and more along with Lara, but I think what really sells it is the great voice acting. The whole thing just progresses really nicely. After starting with nothing you slowly learn new skills and gather new equipment and just a Lara would you're learning to control them at same time. All until the end when you have put everything together to save the day. It's almost perfectly paced and even clothing gets damaged and major wounds persist over time. Although the amount of damage Lara can take is pretty unrealistic if you think about it too much. There were a couple of quicktime events with frustrating timing which annoyed me a little but not enough to ruin the game. Also there was one jump near the end which nearly made me quit after dying over and over again. That was until I realised I was being and idiot and doing it wrong! Overall an awesome game which I really enjoyed, even to the point of going back and making sure I found all the collectables which was fun rather than tedious. I doubt I'll ever go back and play the original games but I'll be striaght on the next one if Crystal Dynamics are still involved.",1,0

532878,203160,Tomb Raider,"Tomb Raider 'reboot' is two games in one: A gunplay heavy action-thriller with QTEs galore, and a laid back adventure / puzzler similar to the TR games from days of yore. Whats interesting is these two games occupy the same space. You are required to play the action game... the puzzler is optional, but you are compelled to play it in order to unlock Lara's skills and weapon upgrades. The game difficulty has been scaled nicely so that more players are likely to finish. Graphically the game is gorgeous and cleanly exploits the PC, and the fiction is excellent. If it weren't for some clumsy QTEs I would give this game a 10/10. Now when do I get the union jack bikini?",1,0

It has a linear/open world can of stlye, which i dont mind. It puts you in an area and you have different options to kill your enemies. The stroy was a bit meh but is interesting enough to keep you somewhat invested. The gun play is good, feels solid (havent played the multiplayer so it could be crap there), not to difficult. The game graphics wise is also very good. There will be moments were you can just admire the landscape. For someone whos just about playing it form the single player and nothing else it will be about 8-11 hours. Someone who tries to perfect the game will take about 11-15 hours. And the people for the multiplayer, i cant say it can vary.

Then when AA started to die I migrated to other games like Battlefield and Call Of Duty. AA3 came out after the shutdown of AA2 and it did not act as a suitable replacment in my opinion. Call of duty died for me after MW2 as the community is full of idiots and the gameplay was meh at best. After recently getting bored of Battlefield too. I have been without a shooter for about 6 months now :(. Then I saw AAPG appear. Was very skeptical at first because of the shambles that was AA3 but went ahead and dived in. I think this game is fantastic! Its great to play on retro maps like Hospital and Bridge again. I really hope they make more official remakes. Like Weapons cache, pipeline and urban assault etc. The gameplay is very stratigic and sqaud based unlike COD where lonewolfing actually works. If you dont work with your team you will lose. The hitboxes are perfect and the gameplay is very fun. The AA community is great as it was back in AA2. Friendly mature players, havent come across any '♥♥♥♥ you hacker, urrrgh aimbot noob, I ♥♥♥♥ed your mum' etc.   Edit,  I do however feel worried that this game is already dying.

Game controlled well except for cover stickyness, vehicles too. Game looks good except for some shadows being artifact-y at times. Probably made for console first but did well. The intended voice control system is horrible both in detection and in that it is either always on or always off (no PTT, can use a menu when it is off but I think it limits what you can tell your team to do).

You not only have to manage the land which your dynasty controls, but the crazy politics within your own family (they will assassinate each other to further their own interests, including you!) At the same time, you have to manage many nobles fighting over land titles, all while watching your enemy dynasties, while plotting your own next move. Eventually, one way or another, your character will die. You suddenly control your new heir. How well accepted he or she will be will depend upon their traits and skills. This is why you need to marry wisely and assign your heirs (and possible heirs) to the ideal tutors. Your son could turn out to be a brilliant strategist, or a raving lunatic! You might find yourself in the position of having to assassinate your own son in order to protect your dynasty.  Literally everything you do in this game involves risk, followed by clever management over the complications which result. This is a game for obsessive personalities, or otherwise those who enjoy intellectual challenges. It easily consumes your time, be warned!

571167,203810,Dear Esther,"This piece is art first and game second. It is that simple. If that bothers you then do not complain or tear it down, just go some place else. This game achieved what it set out to do and that was put poetry to a game engine. Multiple play throughs brings out different dialogue and different story bits. It is best enjoyed in one solid play through, set aside, and returned to for another some time later. Relaxing, evocative, and still brain teasing this is one of the best gaming experiances I've ever had.   10/10 will come back again.",1,0

Sure, it's short, clocking in at a little over an hour, but you can take your time and just mosey through the wilderness, losing yourself in the surroundings in between every little morsel of plot.

Seriously there are 'How to guide's' for booting Max Payne up and playing it. Its like trying to feed your reflection cheese, Rockstar doesnt want it but eventually it takes it.

584801,204100,Max Payne 3,"I enjoyed Max Payne 3. It is a big departure from the first 2 games in the series. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's hard to give it an unconditional recommendation. It has a decent story (for a game), impressive visuals, and good cover-based gunfighting gameplay with the familiar bullet time mechanic. Some of the set piece battles are quite impressive and most of the gunfights are engaging. There are a couple of bad vehicle combat scenes which I just hate in general but they are few and far between. My biggest pet peeve though are the constant in-engine cutscenes that are constant throughout. I appreciate the attempt to inject story but it really distracts from the gameplay. Also, the constant post-effect-color-blur-flare thing gets annoying very quickly. I think it's supposed to show you how hung over Max always is but maybe actually giving the player a headache was the wrong way to go about it. Anyway in summary it's a relatively short but well put together action game with a few flaws but if you're a fan of the first 2 it's probably worth playing if you can get it on sale.",1,0

589349,204300,Awesomenauts,"Sadly, I am going to have to agree with many of the other reviewers here. The new XP system has broken the game. I'm all for making moves to increase game speed, but this move makes games impossible or incredibly easy, depending on how the dice roll for you at match making. If you have a leaver and a bot fills in until another player can be found, you're out of luck. The other team will quickly overtake you in damage, even if you play flawlessly. Have a feeder? He WILL lose you the game, and there is nothing you can do.   The last game I played, I was 6-0, doing pretty well. I was completely maxed on upgrades. Unfortunately, I had a team member who fed a bit, and we started out with a bot for the first 5 minutes. Try as I might, no matter how many times I bested the other team and pushed them into a retreat, they would simply pick up a kill from one of my team mates and bide their time. Eventually, they rushed our base, and there was nothing I could do.  I would have picked this game over any other MOBA before trying it with the new patch. Now, I'm not so sure.",-1,1

595239,204300,Awesomenauts,"Otherwise very fun 2D MOBA, but suffers from few gamebreaking issues.  Small playerbase which causes unbalanced matches and slow matchmaking , is very notable on higher ranks. You can end up against premade team of 3 top tier players by yourself with 2 bots, no question who is going to win. Bots are either ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or literally aimbots. Some character skills/items are frustratingly overpowered like Raelyns timerift, Ayla's boots and so on. Anyone can force start game after perioid of time. (great idea) Leaderboards reset every 2 months or so and everyone can end up againts everyone, im sure its fun for a beginner to get absolutly stomped by someone who have played over 1000 hours. Players host servers and if host lags everyone does, that sure is fun.  Fix all above and it's great and worth recommending.  Free tip for devs, make it F2P and make money from skins and stuff.

The enemies in the game aren't very difficult to kill on their own (they go down pretty quick actually) the only time i ever died was when I was swamped with so many enemies that I could barely move, they were hitting me so much (Whenever you're hit, you can't move or attack for a second). While I complain about these things, the enemies are probably WAY easier to deal with when you have 3 buddies at your side. The only other thing I have to complain about is the controls. I don't have a good controller to play with, so I was stuck with keyboard. Nuff' said. Anyway, this is all trivial stuff that you shouldn't worry yourself about.

616333,204450,Call of Juarez Gunslinger,"This game was surprisingly bad. One would expect good fps story based game looking at the ratings. Unfortunately what seems like good story turns out extremely repetetive after few missions. The fps aspect is not much better, strongly scripted corridor shooter with enemies appearing out of thin air (even when it is not meant as story tool). Sometimes enemies just ignoring bullets when shooting them in point blank distance. The last notice worth part are duels with quite crude executed minigame. It would be fine if it was based on precision, speed or both, but when you add quite strong random factor you won't get anything enjoyable.  So unless you are great fan of Wild West and games about it you will be better with some other game.",-1,0
616398,204450,Call of Juarez Gunslinger,"TBH I am a little dissapointed. I bought this game cheap-as-chips on sale and so it wasn't the gushing user reviews that encouraged me to buy, however I do believe that they mislead me as to the quality of the game.  Let me start by saying that the game is not awful... that being said I found the story incredibly short and oh so predictable and the gameplay itself very linear and repititive and I in fact much preferred COJ: Bound in Blood.  I will say this the shooting can be quite enjoyable at times especially with the steam controller but the story constantly telling you what's going to happen or what didn't happen gets old really quickly. I personally am not a fan of the controller response on the duels and I lamented the loss of the bow and arrow/ throwing knives (from the previous installment) particularly the ability to make quiet kills. In this game instead you end up finding that you cannot approach the enemies in creative ways you best job is to treat it like a platformer and run in guns blazing because the enemy will only appear when you get close to them.  I found the cartoony atmosphere after a while detaches you from being absorbed into the gameplay especially combined with the constant narration. The story itself was very short I tried to be patient with the story telling but all in all you won't end up spending longer than 10 hours in the game.   Maybe I have been spoilt by the plethora of open world and sandbox games but the feeling of hand-holding I got throughout this title was infuriating to say the least. It's not to say I can't appreciate fixed level design as many other games get it spot-on but when you know you are simply going to face a stream of dull NPC baddies before repeating it over and over again the motivation to accept the direction of the level design becomes tiresome.  All in all... I am left to conclude that this game is essentially a shooting version of a walking simulator that took a healthy step backwards from the previous installment. Whilst the developers made a bold decision in their choice of colours and theme and method of revealing the story It feels like an exercise meant to attract acclaim rather than please the gamers who parted with their hard-earned money.   My answer is No to recommending the game at full price, buy it for a quid it will be over faster than two shakes of a sheeps tail and you will feel no better or wose at the end.",-1,0
616423,204450,Call of Juarez Gunslinger,"Call of Juarez Gunslinger is an awesome FPS game from Ubisoft. Gunslinger turned back to CoJ roots. Events take place in the Wild West and you play the role of Silas Greaves, the bounty hunter who is chasing and hunting down the most notorious outlaws such as Billy the kid, Jesse James, Dalton brothers etc. The game has RPG elements, you get XP points for killing enemies and completing tasks. As ypu level up you can unlock diverse abilities that are required for your survival at harder difficulties. The story takes cca 6 hours to end, but Gunslinger has two new game modes: Arcade and Duel. In Arcade mode you have to fight through an entire area as quick as you can keeping your combos high for the highst score. In Duel there are total 15 shootouts to be won honorably but you have only 5 lives, so if you die 5 times Duel is over and you must start from the beginning.

622332,204760,Deep Black : Reloaded,"It's not very good.  Pros: The underwater sections are quite pretty. Sometimes there is innovation in the underwater maps. The maps are generally fairly big and are mostly single maps that sometimes wrap around themselves nicely. There is some variety in the enemies but they're mostly reserved for special encounters, which is maybe good because many of them are irritating. Headshots do high damage.  Cons: (many) Headshots do high damage. Stepping out from cover to go down to one lucky shot, really gets old. It's a generic over-the-shoulder shooter. Supposedly it's a PC native but it sure feels like a half-hearted console port. Controls are poorly chosen and can't be remapped, examples: mellee and grenade are next to each other, alt-fire and change weapon are on the same button (mouse scroll button). These lead to all sorts of accidents under pressure where you change to your pistol instead of using a powerful attack, or drop grenades at point blank when melleeing enemies. Many enemies have stun-lock and you just get to watch for a few seconds before you die. Some of the battles are very. very hard. I repeated one fight for about ten hours in total. I think most people would have given up. It's usually worth using glitches. Hacking enemy drones is a thing but it can be very hard to pull off sometimes as it randomly fails without reason. Sometimes this happens many times in a row and you die. The surface maps are things you've seen before many times. The armour's glowing health meter is a fairly direct rip of Dead Space, maybe that doesn't matter though. You move very slowly when leaving cover or changing direction, there is no run button and the 'roll' mechanic is pretty useless. This leads to you slowly taking small steps in combat when you try to retreat. Retreating is generally suicidal. Mellee is a one-button kill, assuming you didn't fumble and hit grenade. This makes the mellee enemies (one human, one drone) more or less harmless. Enemy mellee attacks do light damage and you have maybe ten seconds to hit 'f' when they attack you before they might succeed in killing you. The various unlocks that you get in the game (infinte ammo, golden gun) can't be used. They literally do not do anything when activated.  Summary: The game isn't exciting and doesn't really have anything new. Hydrophobia did water better, there are dozens of shooters that do combat better. Being second-best to Hydrophobia isn't harsh criticism though the surface game isn't exciting so really, I should have just played Hydrophobia again.  The biggest con of all is that getting the game working in the first place requires some non-trivial research. I'll save you the time, this game will not run unless you implement a firewall rule in Windows to prevent it dialing home to the original developer's website. They do not support the game anymore (sold it to some third party that put it on steam) so the steam version will not run in its released form. You must make a firewall rule to block the game's .exe from internet. This also cancels multiplayer but since no one is playing it in MP anwyay, that's no big deal. ",-1,0

632599,205100,Dishonored,"Well a good game, and I enjoyed having the choice of playing a protagonist with a moral compass, I always took the high road and didn't kill, even those that had wronged me, and also liked having the option of keeping innocents alive. Non lethal options are a good thing in games and as a result I didn't even see the melee kill animations. I think I killed 3 people throughout the whole story and that was unavoidable to help the characters I wanted to help (as far as I could tell). Really enjoyed finding alternative ways to 'assassinate' my target without killing them, for instance branding a man a heretic so he'd be exiled was a favourite... just because it was so smoothly done.  All in all a great game, but not a game I'd rate super highly just because it isn't generally my thing sneaking around etc. I recognise quality when I play it though.

647793,205100,Dishonored,"This games just boring, and I say this as someone who likes stealth games.  I tried playing this a while ago, but the broken blink ability they shove in your face made me get bored and quit. I decided to try again because recently I played another game made by the studio who made this. That game was Dark Messaih and its stealth was pretty fun and solid, so I thought to myself. Why don't I play this game like DM? Just ignore the broken spells, and go around sneaking around occasionally stabbing a ♥♥♥♥♥.  Well I tried and it's ♥♥♥♥ing boring.  The levels are pretty well designed, but that's the only good thing I can say about this game.  I tried avoiding using the tranquilizer crossbow because it was broken. Deus ex had one like it, but you NEEDED to land a headshot and be maxed in pistols for it to work like how it does in this game, and in deus ex they gave you like 12 bolts at most across like 3 missions that are long as ♥♥♥♥, so you had to be smart with how you use them.  Knocking people out by sneaking from behind takes a solid 2 seconds, which makes it kind of not satisfying at all. In thief the dark project or metal age, you had the blackjack and could knock people out just by hitting them in the back of the head which was faster and a lot more fun.  Because of this I decided to be lethal and play like Dark Messaih. Stabbing ♥♥♥♥♥es who got in my way, generally trying to avoid people but killing them if they got in my way. Except the game throws a ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥ fit about killing things. You're an assassin and the game heavily implies all over the place not to kill, and it even includes leaving unconcious bodies on the ♥♥♥♥ing ground as a kill, which in itself is ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Well since your balance is all ♥♥♥♥ed up, your story is absolute ♥♥♥♥ (watered down deus ex, with a splash of thief's atmosphere), your characters are unlikable, and the occasional unskippable cutscene slowing everything down I don't really care if I get a bad ending or make people sad. Except when it starts throwing zombies at you (yeah they're zombies, get over it), talking about how the city is going to ♥♥♥♥ because of you, etc it makes an already boring slow paced game even less gratifying to play. And you're already OP as ♥♥♥♥ so if you kill anything you might as well will use the broken powers anyways since it's not going to change much.  I'm more disapointed than I thought I would be.",-1,0

It took me less than 3 hours to 100% the game, minus a few odds and ends achievements that I could go back and do in less than 10 minutes. Don't buy this if you expect a good value for your money, because 5 dollars an hour is more expensive than the average movie time to price value. Laughably easy, a story that seems shoehorned in to try and keep the gameplay in line and a gadget variety so small you really do feel like a spy on a budget. Don't expect the gameplay to change from switching light switches to doors and cameras to doors until the last level, where a 'big' surprise lies in wait for you. (Hint: It's not that big, but it changes how you can tackle early levels.)  Shortcap: In less than 3 hours you can A+ every level, get 95% of the achievements and crush the story without mercy. Not worth 10 bucks, but 5 dollars or less it's a solid buy, especially if you're a big supporter of indie games.  I'm a little disapointed by the creator, as this game could have gone seriously far.

665944,206190,Gunpoint,"Starts off slow, but gets progressively more involved. In this game you move, pounce, trick, rewire to evade your enemies and collect intel across a 2-D plane. I bought this during the winter sale because I thought it was similar to Bonanza Bros for the Sega Genesis. I wasn't too wrong, but it strays mechanically from the formula quite a lot. You play as a P.I. who gets involved in a larger conspiracy between multiple factions. The narrative plays out through text messages that give you a fake semblance of 'choice.' The core element of the game seems to be rewiring contraptions around the buildings you infiltrate, which isn't very deep. Thematically, I understand the concept of being about to rewire a motion sensor that a guard walks past to open a door in your way, but how it's handled doesn't make much sense. You can perform any of these rewireing actions at any place, anywhere. It takes away from the tension of evasion, that it doesn't really feel like much work to do. I also ran into a couple bugs in the game that caused me to close it out of frustration.  Overall, the game was decent for it's price during the winter sale, but I wouldn't strongly recommend it.",-1,0

690382,206440,To the Moon,"This is my first review (and probably the only game I'll review in my whole life), but I thought that this game deserved a review.  This game is just awesome, and that probably isn't the correct description of it. From the beginning to the end 'To The Moon' gave me a whole lot of emotions: it made me laugh with a lot of situations with both doctors –Dr. Watts and Dr. Rosalene –, it made me cry a LOT (and that means A LOT, because I rarely cry), and of course it made me happy and sad at the same time. And that's what I'm looking in most of these games: to make me feel all these emotions, feel what the game is trying to say.  The soundtrack also helped a lot with it. The soundtrack gave me chills when I first heard it. Laura Shigihara's 'Everything's Alright' is certainly the best soundtrack in the game, along with 'For River'. To be honest, the whole soundtrack is good.  If you want a good soundtrack, that goes well with the story, and the story itself is good and it makes like you NEED to know how it ends, that makes you emotional, then you have your game. 'To The Moon' is certainly the best game I have played, and probably will be the best game I will ever play, that's for sure.",1,0
690495,206440,To the Moon,"I'm a bit late to this game, but eventually decided to play it after countless recommendations, and I have to say, the game surprised me. My expectations weren't overly high, since many other popular RPG maker games that are deemed to be classics ended up disappointing me. But not this game. You get to journey through a man's life by visiting his memories and seeing which people and events have had an impact on him. The game starts off slowly, but the pace picks up after the first half hour and it just kept me wanting to know more.  Some parts did feel a bit unfocused or dragged too much, and also many of the male scientist's remarks were rather out of place in a game like this and broke immersion. I also wasn't a fan of a strange corridor mini-game with booby traps later on (yes, I am not joking). I personally thought that scene didn't need to exist at all because it didn't fit with the serious nature of the game's story. But other than that, I found the story to be emotional and very touching. The puzzles were all very simple and fun. You never get stuck too long trying to solve any of them.  I also thought the music was fantastic. It really helped to enhance the emotions in each scene.  Overall, I would recommend this game if you're after an emotional story that will pull on your heartstrings. It might not be for everyone, but it's certainly worth checking out. If you're after a more gameplay-heavy game though, you probably wouldn't like it.",1,0

691342,206440,To the Moon,"Hello fellow gamers!   *Updated Review Edited by well me*  I feel it's important to note that before reading my review last year Markiplier played this game, so just know immediately if a well-known Youtube Let's Player enjoyed this game you will too! If you are unsure just watch his let's play like I had before purchasing and find out first hand for yourself the experiene in all it's grandure.   What does 'To The Moon' offer without giving away spoilers? Well as the game suggests in the description you get to interchangeably play two scientists who's job are to give patients whom are dying to relive their lives to fullfill a wish. Though most RPG's are turn based and you attack monsters etc, this is not the style of this RPG game. Instead it's broken up into 'Acts' with an impressive story. That is what is so amazing about this game. The developers managed to construct a story that is told to you backwards, and then you get to see the results of all the hardwork that you had done to grant the wish. You think it's going to go oneway, but it goes another by way of keeping you on your seat wanting to know where the story goes next. It also plays on your emotions in the way of making you laugh, feel happy, and feel sad. Even though you get to see the story from the scientists point of view you can't help but wondering if you had the same opportunity for people to figure out your wish and make it happen what would you wish for?   Without giving anything away beyond what the description says I would highly recommend this game if you enjoy some puzzles, have the habit of exploring and feeling the need to talk to everyone in the game, enjoy good dialog, amazing story telling, and wouldn't mind that there are no battles to be had. This still qualifies as a Role Playing Game in my book and though I had to take some short breaks to cook the game roughly took me 4 hours to play from start to finish. That's how I would suggest the game to be played to get the full theaterical effect the game has to offer.   Great game, though I bought it during the summer sale I must confess that I wish the developers got the reguar price from me. The soundtrack is beatufiul as well so I definitely recommend getting the collectors edition bundle that offers the mini-episodes and the original soundtrack. I haven't played the mini-episodes yet, but the developers state that in order for them to make sense one must compete the regular game first! So these are my two cents from me! I hope whomever reading this will be just as taken back as I am with this game.   Best of luck!   One gamer to a bunch!",1,1
692463,206440,To the Moon,There's a great sentimental core but the game just lacks any sort of useful interactivity. It would almost be better as an indie movie or short story.   The main gameplay consists of mainly being an item hunt and followed by clicking through dialogue and the occasional simple puzzle. It neither has the richness of writing to make it something like a visual novel like Analogue or provide enough interactivity to tell it's story through the mechanics of the game like Gone Home.   The visual style often conflicts with the story's more emotional moments for instance because of the 16-bit graphics characters will give items to one another by lobbing the item on the floor infront of themselves. The 16-bit RPG style does not really benefit the story and the gameplay doesn't add to the emotion. It's not that you can't make something beautiful from a limited art style but you have to use those things to your advantage. The horror game Home takes the same art style and uses the vagueness pixels can cause to create a bone chilling atmosphere for instance. It's just that To The Moon never utilizes this art style and rather it seems like an art style the developer may just be used too or rely too much of nostalgia.   There's a lot of heart but it lacks the substance and engagement to make To The Moon shine through.,-1,0

It was great, a simple PVP game with interesting characters and all the cash shop items could easily be purchased with in-game currency based on your performance during matches. It was everything I liked in a game. Why give it a thumbs down, then, you ask?  Well, first of all, the developers have decided to completely abandon this game because of poor marketing strategies, so no new things will ever be added. The biggest reason of all, though, are the people.  In the past few weeks I came back to this game, expecting it to be that fun and highly competitive game I loved so much. But to my repulsion it's basically become a 'if you hax u win' type deal. It's  filled  with nothing but people who like to spam hacks to win, and gloat about it after. These people don't even have the actual skill to play, only how to pull up base files and edit.

723968,207420,Wizorb,"The Arkanoid-clone genre has never been one to top any charts. Unfortunately, this game doesn't do anything to change. That really is unfortunate in this case because this game does retro so well. It's got music that reminds me of Legend of Zelda, and I could see myself playing this on one of the old consoles, with the game's title art prominently displayed on its cartridge. The controls serve their purpose, although that may be where the problems start to come in. Aside from the paddle, you only control spell casting/ball launching. It's all pretty standard faire here really, which when it comes to Arkanoid clones, means it comes up as short as the genre.  To give some examples of fine genre features that don't benefit the fun factor: why can the ball travel faster from left to right than my paddle under any conditions? It means I often get to watch the ball go kerplunk, and consequently I'm constantly left wishing my paddle was just slightly faster. I can literally watch seconds tick off the clock as I know I'm about to lose a ball and there's nothing I can do about it. Why not have a little stamina bar that I can burn down to move faster for a short time, and then wait for it to refill (manually or automatically)? Why in 2012 (the game's release date) do I still have to choose between getting a powerup and not dieing? This is perhaps one of the worst feelings: constantly watching your powerups drop off the screen because the only way to get them is to touch them with the paddle. Why not have them sit there and require me to hit them with the ball? Or why not pick them up automatically once I've destroyed whatever block contained them and they are revealed? Or why not have a little automated helper that picks them up? Players experience less of what the game has to offer in the ways of powerups and spell-casting (since one of the powerups restores magic) because of this mechanic.  I imagine the die-hard Arkanoid-clone fans would thoroughly enjoy this game and may even explain the number of positive reviews. I however felt myself wishing for something that better addressed what I (and likely many others) have felt are the genre's shortcomings. Not a bad game, but perhaps a little too much of the same ol' same ol' if you're not a big fan of this genre already. 5/10.",-1,0

With other options like Dungeons of Dredmor and Tales of Maj'Eyal being superior in every way, I just can't recommend this title.",-1,0
724431,207430,"Hack, Slash, Loot","Hack, Slash, Loot: Not, Very, Good  There have been multiple occasions wherein I have tried to play Hack, Slash, Loot. Both times didn’t last very long… As you can tell by my total play time of an hour. I’m just gonna be straight and say I don’t like this game. But the fact that I’m reviewing it after an hour should be more than enough evidence of that.  The main issues I have with Hack, Slash, Loot stem from the fact that it is based entirely around luck, it’s rather shallow, and frankly it’s just unengaging. Also I wanted to play it more, but it’s now continuously crashing; thus preventing me from even giving the game another chance. It’s almost as if the game knows I’m not fond of it and it’s hiding from further examination!  Crashing aside Hack, Slash, Loot definitely has some cool ideas, but the game’s execution could definitely have used some work. When the game launches, after you’ve taken about five minutes to parse the UI, you can pick from a rather large selection of quests-- these are essentially the game’s ‘campaigns’; and four character classes. The game’s various quests are really just a set of parameters on the random dungeon generation. Apparently the dungeons span multiple floors and also contain bosses but I’ve never lived long enough to see one…  This is because the game pits you off against a nearly unending horde of monsters that do far too much damage, have way too much health, and almost comically out number you. Plus healing items are few and far between due to the random nature of the game’s loot. In the hour I’ve played I’ve probably run through thirty or forty dungeons.  Let that sink in.  My longest run was probably 20 minutes, and I still never made it past the first floor. Hell, I’ve died in the room that I spawned in.  Fighting hordes of powerful enemies can definitely be fun, other games prove this. But Hack, Slash, Loot’s reliance on luck permeates into the combat as well. Even with a 60% chance to hit I find myself missing the majority of my shots. A fight with a single monster can take upwards of ten turns or more, which are spent watching your character and the monster haplessly flail at one another only occasionally connecting. Once you finally land a hit and damage to the monster you have to hope that you roll well... or you’ll find yourself dealing almost no damage, making the fight take even longer.  There’s nothing like missing ten attacks only to land one and deal 2 damage.  The best way I can describe this game is that it feels like a Pen and Paper RPG, like Pathfinder… But without any of the systems that actually allow you to do the cool stuff.  There are no modifiers that help your dice rolls, or give you an edge. It’s just raw randomness.  Most of the time you simply rely on luck, and hope that the five orcs breathing down your neck miss more than you do. Or that you get a good weapon that can deal decent damage. But that only happened to me once, and then I promptly died.  This game definitely has potential. And it’s clearly there under the layers of randomness… But as it stands Hack, Slash, Loot isn’t worth your time.",-1,0
725754,207530,Noitu Love 2 Devolution,"Ah, a retro indie game. This game reminds me of the mediocre games that were barely passable 20 years ago.

Just keep pressing the button until the enemy dies. I do not recommend this game.",-1,0
725790,207570,English Country Tune,"3D Sokoban with complex rules. There aren't very many types of blocks to get used to, but the rules governing each of them are surprisingly deep, and even at the beginning of the game, you really have to understand all of the subtle rules thoroughly in order to plan ahead and complete each level. For example, the 'larva' blocks are pushed around when you run into them. But gravity applies to them selectively, and you absolutely must understand how gravity works in order to get them to fall into the right positions.  Because of the complex rules, you need to plan ahead - guessing rarely gets you to the correct solution. And as a result, completing a hard level, at least to me, gives a Dark Souls-like satisfaction. You *earn* your victories!  Some of the other reviewers don't like the minimalist, abstract music and art, but I think they're beautiful. You can see for yourself what it looks like form the screenshots and videos and decide if the art is up your alley or not.",1,0
725965,207650,A Virus Named TOM,"My Take: Think Pipe Mania and Tron Lightcycle. Redirect the virus' infection by rotating the circuits while dodging the anti-virus countermeasure drone spiders. Elements such as locked circuits and red game over blocks get thrown in later. Eventually, you get to a point where it's solely based on timing your moves around the spiders. Tedious.  Graphics: The character and level design are simple, but worked for what they are. The little cutscenes follow an art style reminiscent of what you would see on Cartoon Network in the mid 90's, just not as good. Also the resolution is locked at 1280x720 so if you switch the settings to 1980x720, you get a horrible border all the way around the screen.   Sound: So little going on here that the only thing worth mentioning is the respawn noise is annoying.  Music: Surprisingly solid with a track or two I'd actually listen to outside the game.  Controls: Simple enough bindings, you've got directional controls, glitch drop, and circuit rotation. The game recommends the controller, but you can honestly make do with the keyboard. I couldn't tell any difference in the gameplay between the two.  Did I Finish It: No.  Will I Finish It: Eventually, but I'm so irritated with the later levels, I'm taking an indefinite break.  Should You Buy It: Only if the concept interests you, snag it in a bundle or if you see it for 80% or less. ",1,0

727817,207750,Symphony,"Symphony is another way of enjoying your music. This addictive and engaging casual shooter uses your music to configure the levels which you play. The game on itself is not very long... the story mode, at least, but as long as you want to just shoot something without complications and good challenge (do not forget the point of having your music integrated in the game), this little jewel will make wonders, so the real life of symphony is as long as big is your music library.  The mechanical is quite simple. You choose one song, and then, depending of its characteristics it throws to you to beat (and to strike you down mercilessly) one thing or other, and while you shoot and dodge cool lights you must collect inspiration points which raise your marker and at the same time repair your.... spaceship ?  I bought it just for experimenting and i'm far beyond than pleased with it.",1,0
728213,207750,Symphony,"It is a very interesting game to say the least. Many games have tried to create an environment where the world reacts to the music playing, and Symphony kinda does that. It analyzes your music saved to your machine (For which I give them props. I like how we're not limited to the music already within the game) and supposedly coordinates enemy amount, aggression, and type to the music. From what I can tell, it only analyzes volume changes which seems a bit lacking because bass-heavy songs will yield easier enemies than the song's beat will imply.  I wish it had more variety to the difficulty modes whilst playing (The color changes indicating enemy's aggresion). Three difficulties just doesn't seem like enough. I don't know about later stages in the game, because I've only gotten to the Mezzo-Piano difficulty, which leads me into my next point.  How do you save this game? There's no save button in the menus, and there's no autosave function after every completed song, so how am I supposed to save progress? I signed up for that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t service they have in-game which I thought would allow you to save your game. but so far I can't tell if it worked. 'Continue' on the main screen is still grayed out so I'm convinced there just isn't a save funciton in this game which is really, really bad. Playing for an hour only to accidentally go back to the home menu and losing all your progress because you clicked RMB makes this game feel like a waste of time, even though the actual game part of it is awesome. And yes, who in their right mind makes RMB a previous menu key? At least it's not active during gameplay, just in the menus.  But as for the actual game, Symphony is pretty cool. The colors are bright and vivid, and the explosions are just the right size. The glow effect from some weapons can prove to be distracting (Level 3 Scatter Cannon cough cough) but it is manageable after you get to recognize enemy ships. I experienced my mouse sensitivity suddenly skyrocketing a couple times but I believe that is a problem on my end as I've had it happen to me in other games as well.  Customisability is lacking in the aesthetics department, but all weapons look and feel diverse excluding the rare versions of the same weapon. I wish we could customize the look of our actual ship, instead of having the same falcon-like body throughout the game.  Final Verdict: 7/10 - While I thoroughly enjoy this game, the lack of an obvious save feature really breaks the balance between having an awesome game and a pile of crap. The game part of Symphony is very good and fun to play, and the diversity of weapons is great, and the art style is just hands-down beautiful, but god damn, they just couldn't get the menu system right! No obvious save button turned this gem of an Indie game into a pile of crap. HOWEVER, it is a very pretty and well polished piece of crap. If this game goes on sale, get it. You'll have fun for a couple minutes or hours before you lose your save game.  Afterthought: Locating your music files is weird. You have to use an in-game explorer to find your music folder which is weird. I think they should've just let it open Windows Explorer or whatnot instead.",-1,0
728693,207930,Sacred Citadel,"Okay so where should I start.. Let's start with the negative stuff cause that's usually what people look at anyway. The game has a few flaws that I cannot get over: -Depth Perception Issues. Not only is it often so, that you're being attacked by enemies that you cannot attack because you're not in the same depth, but it's also hard to tell which depth they're in at all, leading to some frustration from time to time. Also some items might sometimes drop in a depth that you cannot even reach. -It's not hard. Now you might say this is very relative, but for me, these kinds of games is about growing in power, since you level and acquire new gear, so that you may overcome harder challenges. This point is especially important since your experience &amp; gold is saved, even if you die, so you can just keep doing the same thing til' you get past it. Sure, you might die here there once or twice, but we beat every level in the first try and overall found the game to be too easy. Even on the last boss we made it without grinding a single level twice and we didn't even dodge most of his attacks. -The game is very short. A little over 5 hours of gameplay was enough to beat the entire game with one class, and that's taking into account idling in the menu probably about 30 minutes and restarting it due to bugs like being unable to move or even just crashes.  -Tanky monsters. When I'm saying that I'm not talking about the bosses, the bosses are fine. But this is something I see very often in games. Instead of making the monsters challenging enough, you make them very tanky, so that it'll still take time to take them down. It's not fun, it's just repetitive and tedious. -Constant knockback. You're constantly being knockbacked, there's really nothing to explain here, you'll spend at least about 30% of your time in combat lying on the ground.  Those are the main points for me that are bad. But here's the good ones. -Story. It's definitely not that great of a story, but it's somewhat humorous and you want to find out what happens, so I have no complaints, the story did what it was supposed to do, it made me want to play on. -Gear, I felt the excitement for getting a better weapon/armor. That's at least more than what many other games do. -Pretty fun multiplayer. Since you're constantly getting knockbacked, mashing buttons, filling up the screen with you power attacks or getting thrown around and ending up in bad positions, it's pretty fun to play co-op in it. As always it's more fun to play with friends. -Music. The music was not that kind of music that got stuck in your head or something you'll sing/dig along to, but it was decent, and I have no complaints about it either.  -Graphics. The graphic design is nice and overall I enjoyed going through the world, especially paying attention to the background scenery at times.   Overall I must say this is a pretty mediocre game from a game design perspective, but it was decent entertainment for the 5 hours I played it. Do I consider it to be worth 10 euros though? No.",-1,0

743880,208090,,"This game would be a lot of fun if they would nerf or just simply remove launchers all together. There is literally no point in using anything else since it's so powerful, it's basically all anybody uses anyway which makes the game boring. At the very least they could make it so you can't reload while jumping/rolling and sprinting. That weapon alone is just broken, especially when paired with double jump. Then there are the game crashes, I'm lucky if I can play an entire match without the game closing out on me. To make it worse, people are constantly joining games and leaving/crashing out so your team gets filled with bots while the other team steam rolls. I feel like it would be better to balance teams mid game by just having someone on the opposing team switch sides. Some of the mechanics are broken too, I've seen bots take the hammer and go to cap it, only for a person to join and the hammer be automatically returned when the spot is filled. Spawns aren't that great either when I'm playing Blitz, why are we spawning so close to the node? If anything the spawn timer needs to be increased or it just becomes a nuke fest between grenades and launchers. This game could be a lot of fun, but they really need to fix the weapon imbalance first.",-1,0

747150,208140,ENDLESS™ Space - Definitive Edition,"6/10  What a dumb game. After researching this and another space strategy title I decided to go for this one since it was part of the Steam sale ($7 something so not so much of a loss on this 'investment'). While it has its charm the tech tree and some of the rules related to how to play the game are ridiculous.  Say you have 7 ships (destroyers or corvettes, no difference in tonnage so does not matter which - another stupid tech tree option but I digress), and you have an additional group of 7 ships of the same type. That leaves you with 14 ships right? NOPE. You have the enemy show up with 12 ships and they attack the 7 while the other 7 sit in the same star system and watch their comrades in arms get blown to bits without interveneing.   How can this game be rated so high with such an obvious lack of logic in the tech tree is beyond me. You have to research the ability to put more in your fleet which is completely stupid. I understand the adminral might not be able to do as well with more ships but then just give a battle penalty or something until he improves or until he researches the required tech, do not just limit ships at 7 or 9 per armada until you research the tech to put more in your fleet, this kills the game.  Further where they have stuff in the tech tree is annoying as it forces you to go back and forth between tech areas (the one on the left verses the one on the bottom).  The game is not all bad, but compared to the strats of Civilization 4 or 5, Europa Universalis 4, Master of Orion 2, or Space Empires 5, Endless Space is a waste of money. Space Empires 5 especially was MUCH MUCH BETTER in terms of game mechanics, as of course was Master of Orion 2.   For those really into the space battles and who feel that is why this game is great, check out Sins of a Solar Empire (I think it was Sins, someone feel free to correct me if not and I will figure out which one it was as there is one game where you have space battles VERY similar to Babylon 5 the tv series). MUCH better firefights...  Anyhow I digress. I still have yet to finish my first game so maybe I will change my mind once I get use to the tech tree (I find it problematic to find anything I want to research as the names for things are not intuiative in my opinion), but honestly I am so disappointed. Here I was thinking I was finding a diamond in the rough (excuse the cliche) and instead I found a ring missing the diamond, not bad but definitely not as good as it could be, and not as good as many titles that came before it that they could have followed...  1st edit: (after 15 hours) - still standing by all my initial statements above...the tech tree setup is horrible, I want to research what I need to bomb my enemies, no civilopedia or anything like you would get in Civilization, and YOUTUBE and guides online do not cover quite a number of my questions at all (some were answered though you have to research a lot). Went through a period where I was taking 999 turns to research something and though I knew why (random event affecting science), would have been nice to see a countdown on how many more turns I would have to suffer...if you are into games where you want to understand what is going on all the time, this is not it, if you are into games where you need to research a ton online (Europa Universalis) and trial and error and figure out what is going on all the time this is not it either. You want a game that you are 'flying blind' in a number of areas for a LONG TIME (15 hours and counting at the moment), than this is it. I am winning my current game but still I just want to bomb the enemy (yeah yeah I need invasion points more than they do or something like that, where do I even find that, trial and error figuring out how to build something that can bomb or bring invaders, would not be that hard in reality, I got a ship, I got an asteroid belt, they have no ships, I shoot them from the sky with rocks until their cities are in shambles...no option for something like that here, bah...)",-1,0
747269,208140,ENDLESS™ Space - Definitive Edition,"I was very much looking forward to a decent modern 4X game. Having very much enjoyed the Master of Orion games and Ascendancy from the DOS days, I was hoping for something new and exciting from the genre. I had tried Galactic Civilizations 2 before and it was clunky, uninspired and unfun, maybe this would be different?  This game was completely unfun to play from the beginning. It was very frustrating all around and I couldn't get into the game at all. The star system looks beautiful, I love the way the worlds look and slowly rotate, esp. since you can zoom in on each one... but the UI and game play were not intuitive nor entertaining.  The races seemed largely unoriginal, and almost all of them were based on humans, unlike the vastly different races available in Master of Orion and Ascendancy. The tutorials just had popup text over the actual window and only told you what parts of the view port were, not how to use them. Way too much informationation all at once, and not letting you actually poke at any of them while explaining things did not help you figure it out.  It took a long time to figure out how to even move ships. I noticed a ship icon next to my home world and couldn't figure out how to tell it to move until I right clicked directly on a system and away a ship went. Right clicking a little bit off just unselected the ship, so I kept thinking I was doing something wrong, and the mouse cursor doesn't change to indicate that the ship would move. Ok... So you right click to move. Except after exploring a nearby system, trying to explore the next star system just doesn't work again (unselecting again), probably because I need some research to be able to travel further from my home world, but I couldn't even figure out what any of the drives did, how to move further, or what was wrong. The game didn't give me a message when I tried to go to nearby stars to tell me why I couldn't go to that one vs this one, it just unselected the movement, like slapping my hand for doing something wrong without saying why. A message saying, 'You need Long Distance Space Exploration' or whatever would have gone a long way here. In fact, looking things up in the Wiki and doing searches for this never came up with the information necessary to explore, and I looked all over through the research tree, which was it's own lesson in frustration.  The research tree gives minimalistic information in popups, that told you the names of what you could get from the research and some story about that research, but didn't tell you a darned thing about the research itself. And you can't mouse over things in the popups to figure out what the heck they are (though Ascendancy also had this problem). The research tree tells you almost nothing useful, and the names of a lot of things mean nothing.  An example: A research you get near the beginning is called 'Compact Fusion Reactors'. This has the text: 'While great leaps forward in fusion technology are on the horizon, the ability to miniaturize and simplify existing fusion technology also provides practical rewards.' - Ok... this doesn't tell me much. It says it unlocks 'Advanced Magnetics Drive' and 'Colonize Arctic'. Ok, I get the Colonize one (though who knows why a new Fusion reactor would unlock colonizing arctic worlds), but what the heck does 'Advanced Magnetics Drive' do? Does it allow my ships to travel further? Faster? Is it a new module for engines for building new ships? Apparently, it just adds 2 movement speed to all of your ships once you get it. I had to look it up on a Wiki to figure out what it did.  The combat system was incredibly confusing from a new player's perspective. I experienced combat on turn 3 with my scout ship up against a couple of pirates... I didn't want to lose my scout ship, so I had all these cards to pick from, so I just picked retreat cause I knew I was going to die otherwise. Then a weird cinematic-ish battle happened where I couldn't tell what was happening at all... and suddenly my ship ran away, back towards my home system. Which is where another pirate was waiting, and this time succeeded in destroying my scout. On turn 4. Great way to learn the game!  I never even met up with another race because I couldn't travel very far in the couple of attempts to play, and was so frustrated by the game at this point, I switched back to playing old MS-DOS 4x games again.

756001,208520,Omerta - City of Gangsters,"This is one of those games that takes a good idea, in this case running a mafia gang in 1920's Atlantic City, but just doesn't deliver on its potential. Each level is set in a different neighbourhood of Atlantic City. You have an overview of that neighbourhood where you can rent or buy buildings and establish illegal or legit businesses or joints. There's also some squad based tactical combat where you control some of your hired gangsters as they fight rival gangs or cops.   Good points: - the games style is pretty good with nice looking maps that pull of the 1920's look quite nicely. The music also adds nicely to the games atmosphere. -running your own mafia gang is pretty fun for the first few hours at least   Bad points: - this game gets very repetitive after a few levels. The basic formula for each level is start setting up businesses, discover more of the neighbourhood, set up more businesses, gather enough money, resources or liked rating to complete objectives, combat mission end. While the campaign has a story and objectives that try to keep things fresh is doesnt stop the repetition creeping in and the game becomes a chore. - the combat sections arent great. Granted its not the gameplays main focus but it doesnt have much depth and combat sections become more of a nuisance later in the game.  I've ticked not recommended for this game instead of recommended but it's really one of those 'somewhere in the middle' games. It's not so much a bad game but it's not good either, just average.

762311,208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"I should start this by saying that I am a fan of the series. I still think the Arkham games are a must play for anyone who likes games, console of P.C. I even went as far as playing through this game even when it first released just because I have a huge appreciation for what the Arkham games brought the table when it comes to world building, art and game design. With that said, the release of this game was a sham. The game was unplayable for a huge chunk of the P.C. fanbase and even those of us who could play it had to deal with countless issues. The season pass was shady, as usual, and months later we've come to find that the DLC that we got was just... disappointing- barely adding anything worth experiencing.   Bugs and DLC aside, the game itself is a bit of a disappointment. The story feels flat and unsatisfying, Riddler is extra annoying with his unnecessarily large amount of trophies and really out of place Riddler races. The Batmobile was a thing you were forced with deal with rather than a fun addition to the game. The cast seems interesting and promising but fails to deliver; I really wanted to see more of Robin and Catwoman, Batman's interaction with his constantly-falling-appart family, anything. It's the last game in the series, give the fans closure... but no. Instead there's a repetitive and predictable story filled with the same tropes and structure anyone who's read a Batman comic in the past 10 years has seen over and over again.   With that said, the gameplay is still good ol' Arkham. Combat is still fun and snappy, beating up thug after brainless thug is still satisfying. The game is gorgeous when it wants to be and the art design is still awesome. I guess that's a plus. Let's face it, if you're a fan of the series you're probably going to get the game anyway but, as much as it pains me to say it, I would hold on to that thought. Wait until it's in a better condition or even better, wait for a  very  deep discount.",-1,1

762522,208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"Ok, let's start off.   First of all, I'm not going to go into detail about the numerous performance issues I've experienced. You can find all of them in other people's reviews. I'm having the same problems everyone else is, and I won't elaborate.   Seriously, Rocksteady?  It's not just the fact that the performance issues are atrocious itself that's the problem I have with this release, though.   The hype train for this game was moving faster than the Enterprise at warp speed, ok, and it was the size of 3 multiverses. Not only that, but the game was even delayed for a month, presumably to ward off ♥♥♥♥♥♥ releases like this one, and it obviously flopped horrendously. You can't honestly tell me that you tested this pc port and greenlit it for release, which is bs, because you knew how heavily anticipated this game was. There's not that much more to say, to be honest. This is apocalyptically horrible and unacceptable by any standard, let alone Rocksteady's. Until this is fixed in its entirety, I refuse to touch this game in any form, and I would extend to anyone reading this review the same advice; do not buy this until it has been completely rectified.   Onto the final point of this review, does anyone have an ETA on when this is going to be fixed? How long did it take for The Witcher 3's release to be repaired, and is Rocksteady working on Arkham Knight's right now? The reason I ask is because knowing how long it took to patch Witcher may give me an estimate on this game's fix. Please leave a response if you have an answer to any of these questions, I would massively appreciate it.  EDIT: WOW! Ok, so going even further into the ♥♥♥♥♥torm. This is just great. People are actually defending these devs? Are you kidding me? Everyone's who's defending this ♥♥♥♥ is saying things like, 'Broken PC ports should be expected at this point, it comes with the territory.' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. That might be the acceptable standard for a game published by activision or EA, but with Rocksteady/ WB this should not be tolerable, especially considering the game we're talking about.

If they resolve the technical isuess with a series of patches the game is a solid 9/10. But given the fact that they felt this product was good enough to be released knowing they would upset the community I cannot recommend paying 60 or 90€ for this unfinished product.",-1,0

Low frame rates, missing effects, extremely dodgy business practices regarding the false advertising claims (sped up footage to simulate 60 fps etc, missing physx features present on console). Fixing the game must be fast and fans who do not refund should be given something substantial as compensation (as bad as Ubisoft are they gave people a brand new flagship game in FC4 when ACU was this broken).  Post re-release edit:  After 3 months (!), three bloody months, essentially with my money as an interest free loan, they come back to me with a game that they say I should have 12gb of RAM to run and if it stutters I should restart the client; and the compensation for the biggest farce in modern AAA gaming is copies of games which I (and probably most of their fanbase) already own and which are up to 6 years old! Shambolic.   FWIW; I enjoyed much of the game because I adore the Arkham series, but the level of dicking around trancends that enjoyment.

Don't get me wrong they fixed the god awful textures and I appreciate that. But this game still chugs and chugs and runs like utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

You can use a custom frame limiter. You can tweak the ini. You can tweak the GPU control panel settings. You can do a myriad of things. One thing you cannot do is keep this game from dropping frames and hitching whenever it damn well pleases.   I love the game. (ex. story, art, character development, missions, gameplay, etc).

779331,208730,Game of Thrones ,"The story and writing are the highlight. It nailed the ASOIAF aesthetic really well, and is beautifully grimdark. It also starts slightly before a Game of Thrones and so sheds an interesting perspective on the first novel, Jon Arryn's troops get a look in for example.   Cyanide/Spider make the same sort of game (Of Orcs and Men, GoT, Mars War Logs and now Bound in Flame which I haven't played). They all have very original, adult(a 15 year old boy view of adult anyway) worlds with a dash of humour and underlying grimness. If you like one you'll like them all, and vice versa if you don't.   The downsides are twofold: they are very unpolished, not buggy which they get called, but not the bioware level of sheen that people seem to expect. They also have a similar, although evolving combat style. In Orcs this was very uninteractive and quite hard, it slowly has become slightly easier and requires more player involvement. It got quite fun in Mars with a dodge roll but in GoT it is a bit slow and mainly comes down to maxing out knockdown/cc skills and then unloading damage on stunned enemies.   They are quite oldskool RPGs in feel, with talking and world development and slightly arcane fighting. GoT was advertised as being an rpg for GoT fans when really it was a GoT game for RPG fans if that makes any sense.   Basically if you like 'proper' rpgs and you like ASOIAF you should give it a try, the beyond the wall dlc prequel is particularly good.  And the special edition with all the dlc is cheaper than the base game so buy that, the beyond the wall dlc is brutal, and well worth a play.",1,0

It has a unique feel and atmosphere to it. Rather than just the usual RPG monsters to fight, there are monsters from fables and fairy tales of long ago. Geralt, the character you play as, is cool. It is an interesting world to get lost in. It has its share of bugs, but none that effected my enjoyment of this game. The original version of this game did not look near as great as this enhanced version does. It feels less like a typical fantasy game and more like a medieval fable from long ago.

I found the combat system fairly boring, and the game at times drove me nuts as it had me walking in a X-like shape across the map (one in particular) and going back and forth and back and forth. I gave up on Oblivion for a similar complaint.  However, unlike other games, I greatly enjoyed The Witcher, despite my couple of issues. The art, lore, soundtrack, overall presentation, storyline and characters in this game were fantastic! All of the lore in the game is actually meaningful to the world, and not some random junk the devs put in the game as a placeholder. There are many optional side quests as well as many main quests.

Whilst I adore the world, as many others do, and found the characters in Geralt's first outing rather charming, they can only do so much to cover up the games fundamental flaws, and it's age. I wish I had discovered the Witcher when it was first released, maybe then I would be more forgiving of it's mindnumbingly dull combat that had me so confused I failed the tutorial several times over. Maybe I could have seen past the seemingly muddled story and found more appreciation for the games lofty goals and unwavering committal to the source material.

It uses Bioware's Aurora engine, but is nowhere near as good an all-round game as Neverwinter Nights. Combat is a tiresome clickfest that's more frustrating than rewarding. The environment, setting and voice-acting are pretty good, but the rest is a chore. Frankly, I'm baffled as to why this resulted in sequels.

794570,209000,Batman™: Arkham Origins,"Ok, first off I'm going to warn you guys that there are SPOILERS in my review, so if you don't want to know, then don't read. Otherwise, in a nutshell, the game was a huge disappointment and, in my opinion, wasn't even worth 5 bucks. I truly wish I could get a refund.   NOW THE REASONS WHY:  First off, the game is extremely glitchy/bugged, which tells me that the company/developers behind the game put out an unfinished and/or untested product on the market, probably because they were in a hurry to get their money.  The fact that I couldn't even get through the first boss fight (which doesn't even take that long to get to ingame) without experiencing an almost game breaking glitch is just pathetic honestly. The fact that the glitch was SO BAD that the music was disappearing, Killer Croc was turning invisible, and then shortly after that the screen went black is probably some of the worst glitching I've seen in a while. The only fix was for me to have to lower my resolution and FX JUST TO GET THROUGH THE FIGHT. Might I mention that I left my settings the same for the rest of the game and had no problems, and this is a well known bug on the internet forums, some people stating they still couldn't fix it, so I'm one of the lucky ones. This is just one game breaking glitch among PAGES UPON PAGES on internet forums that you should probably take into consideration before even bothering with this crappy game.  Now, I'm a person who owns and has played/beaten the other Arkham games, and I can honestly say that the controls and combat are way slower/stiffer/clunkier than the predecessors. There were times where I was going to pull my hair out because the game would alter my settings without me knowing and would invert the camera angles, or my character would activate a gadget I didn't even have selected which would cost me in a fight.  AND FYI, the company behind the game hasn't bothered to fix these glitches at all and from the sounds of it they've practically abandoned the game by now so there won't BE any fixes unless you want to do the freakin programming yourself. BUT OH WAIT IT GETS BETTER  You can't access the ingame built in console (F10) in the vanilla version of the game xD *facepalm*. Wow. So good luck fixing the game. I'll get back onto this subject in a bit, but lets move onto the next issues.  Second, if you're a batman nerd and know your batman trivia, this game is going to drive you insane, especially on the chronological level. The writing for the game was terrible and in my opinion put a number of the characters in situations or saying certain things that I personally felt was not accurate for their character development. Gordon would NEVER be willing to send his men into a dangerous situation, KNOWING Firefly has the bombs set up and threatened to blow up everyone but the vigilante, simply just to SPITE Batman because 'I follow the law and you don't'. Batman would not destroy the Gotham christmas tree simply to be a jerk to a petty insignificant criminal for no necessary/logical reason, especially if he's just starting out as the vigilante and trying to send a message for people to NOT BE JERKS ANYMORE, what a concept. Batman would not simply let Penguin get away because he locked the door, especially considering the WHOLE freaking game has Batman asking Alfred to unlock doors for him. Guess he couldn't be bothered to open one more door. Batman would not simply let Black Mask get away simply because he was fighting an assassin. The moment Batman would get the antidote, he'd be on Black Mask faster than you could say salsaverde. I could go on and on, but you get the idea. Yet later, after Joker is arrested, they play off like Batman's GOT to find Bane and finish arresting him. Oh, so you NEED to finish the job with Bane but who cares about Penguin and Black Mask right?  ALso, let me point out that there was hype for this game having a new villain created for it. This villain is called Anarchy, and from what I gathered, he's basically like the Punisher or an extremist, etc. etc. They play off in the beginning of the game when you beat penguin that he's gonna be this big pain for Batman, and it got me thinking that maybe Anarchy was the joker or something, whatever we'll find out eventually right? NOPE. Turns out that I still don't know much about Anarchy because HE'S NOT EVEN CONNECTED TO THE MAIN STORYLINE AT ALL, HE'S A FREAKIN SIDE QUESTLINE. A side questline which I will never finish because I have no desire to play this game anymore. Lovely.  Now keep in mind that because I was so annoyed with this game, I hardly did any of the side quests at all. I managed to beat the main storyline in (according to steam) 11.6 hours. Honestly, even though the story modes in the other games weren't too much better, at least the game was fun enough to make it seem like it had good replay value and fun to engage, while this game leaves much to be desired.  The actual storyline, for up till Joker gets arrested, actually seemed like there was potential. It kinda had me going for a moment, wondering what WAS going to happen. But after the Joker gets arrested, the story becomes a mess where for some reason Batman HAS to find Bane over everyone else, finds out that Bane somehow knows his secret identity, he temporarily kills alfred, and then for whatever reason goes to Blackgate prison to join up with Joker JUST to play some stupid mind game with heartmoniters and trying to force Batman to kill someone, ALL OF THIS MESS seemingly just to give meaning/purpose to the use of Electrocutionors gloves, which might I add is one of many devices they give Batman in a PREQUEL that he doesn't have in the SEQUELS, gee great to know the staff behind this crap game REALLY cares about continuity and staying true to the true origins of batman *note the sarcasm*.",-1,1
794946,209000,Batman™: Arkham Origins,"Too buggy for my taste.   I picked this up during the sale. Going by the sizeable amount of negative reviews, I already went in with pretty low expectations. Then I got to the tutrial boss and died a couple of times (combination of hard mode and me sucking). That's when the boss decided to flicker like crazy, the sound cut off and after a while the screen blacked out. The problem could be quickly fixed by simply reloading the last checkpoint. But while attempting to beat the boss, I noticed that the same thing kept happing about 1 in 3 times.  Since this seemed indicative of the poor state of the game (and keeping the bad customer feedback in mind), I decided to get a refund, rather than trying to play around a slew of bugs. Now, I'm not saying that you can't finish the game or that you won't have some fun doing it, but I a) don't feel like putting up with a poorly tested game and b) don't want to support a developer/publisher/whoever is to blame that refuses to fix its own game.",-1,0

796053,209000,Batman™: Arkham Origins,"Since it uses the same general map as Arkham City, Origins doesn't feel like it's a completely new game.

Of course 'both' is still an option.  Not only is this game less cohesive than its predecessors, it feels like a way to blatantly shoehorn another certain character back into the series, as well as provide as many other cameos as possible. But the truly unforgivable thing is how horribly glitchy it is. I had no issues with the previous games in the series, but I encountered bugs in Origins that made the session unplayable multiple times. Since the game has been out for two years at this point and I'm still seeing all these issues, I don't anticipate seeing them patched.",-1,0

Well bought this in the Steam Sale. Well, i'm really glad i bought this game. Check your pc can run it. (i only say that because it was in the top10 of graphics intensive pc games in a list i saw). The graphics are brilliant. i'm enjoying the Single Player storyline and is very forgiving on low difficulty so if you're rusty or just don't play many fps and want to give one a shot i'd definitely recommend this. Many different side elements have you in space floating and jetpacking around shooting enemies, repelling down buildings, controlling your attack dog to stealthily attack enemies, flying helicopter gunships to take out targets, using long range sniper rifle, using a silenced pistol with movement locator to take out enemies, aswell as normal assault rifle stuff in different stages of the sp storyline. still playing through the sp storyline so probably a lot more. All i can say is it's fun and coupled with the forgiving aspect, i'd definitely give it 10/10. If you're an experienced fpser i'd probably suggest you read another review for a more relevant opinion on the higher difficulty settings. I normally prefer multiplayer aspect of games (theres something sterile to me playing against bots but being a story its different) and have only tried the extinction mode mp with bots and for a very short time so cant really comment on the mp apart from saying its frenetic-i'll get round to playing mp with other players when ive finished sp storyline(campaign) i expect.. if i'd known the game was like this i'd have bought it full price earlier. there's lots of dlc mp i believe but not bought any yet. only had this game a relatively short period but loving it. jfi i'm using a 360 controller on my pc. it's a great, fun game.",1,0

There is nothing redeeming about this game in any capacity, and that doesn't even include the performance. On my system which is running a GTX 780, an i7-3770k, and 10gb of Ram. The game experiences frequent micro stuttering, weird mouse issues, while providing a level of graphical fidelity that can only be described as lacking. While by this point they had tried to patch out some of the issues by adding an FOV slider in the multiplayer, no such improvement was implemented in the single player portion of this game.

813431,209160,Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Absolute trash! As a COD fan, who has put countless hours in past games, over 120 hours in BO2, I feel betrayed that I have been sold a 60$ game that is so poorly done! I feel foolish for not believing all the hateful reviews for this game, and let it be known, this will be my last COD I ever purchase. Optimization is so poorly done for the PC, I don't even believe they tried! I run a over 1,000$ machine, and I cannot play this out-dated looking game on high, with 1080p? That is garbage and I refuse to ever support this clearly broken game franchise any further! Activision/ Infinity Ward, I hope no one else falls into your trap, and pays any more than 10$ for this terrible game! Easily one of the worst games in my library! Be warned Steam community, Ghosts is poorly optimized, looks exactly the same as MW3, is stripped of all its fun add-ons like: Zombies, Horde-Mode, or even a half-a$$ campaigne! Multiplayer is buggy, unreliable, and laggy to all hell! Stay away from Ghosts like its the ♥♥♥♥ing plague! Get Black Ops 2 if you want a functional COD game. Simply the worst COD ever made, I am foolish for throwing away 60$ on such a poor title. Good-bye COD, you deserve to be shut down!  Concept: A very convoluted storyline with no characters you ever care about, makes the campaigne dull. Multiplayer is a major downgrade from previous COD games and is unacceptable. 40/100  Graphics: Everything looks very grey and dull, nothing looks like it has any life, very low detail in just about everything and low resolution textures are at an all time bad. Doesn't help that a 1k machine can't maintain 60 FPS while a 6 year old console can. 40/100  Sound: Sound effects are actually very well done and feel like they pack a very large punch! On the other hand, the soundtrack is very limited and quite boring to say the least. 75/100  Playability: The FPS stutters constantly, you feel like your gliding on ice, and everything is way to simple. Requires very little skill to be an average player. 60/100  Entertainment: Campaigne isn't even good for a single playthrough, multiplayer is broken to all hell, and the game overall just feels very boring and cheap. 50/100  Replay Value: Very low  Overall Score: 53/100",-1,0
813443,209160,Call of Duty: Ghosts,"Even if you can tweak your game to the random settings via player-made patches, third-party programs and option exploits, even IF you can get the game to run a smooth 60 fps at the sacrifice of graphics, even IF you can get it to play through one round without crashing, or running into one of the many cheaters, boosters, exploiters, ect...this game is still garbage.  The developers have not said word-one about any of the multitude of errors and problems plagueing the PC version, and that itself should tell you to stay far away from this game. Hit-reg is a joke, suffering the same epidemic as BF4 where what you see on screen isn't actually what is happening in-game, causing you to fire at nothing, take fire from nowhere, and just generally die in multiple BS ways. Even the 'perks', which have been the CoD staple since the game hit mainstream, are broken and abused nonstop, with specific ones such as the Guard Dog allowing the mutt to not only to through walls to kill, run across the entire map at random to kill, but also to kill multiple times without going away. It's one of the cheapest perks to get, and also the most deadly. Nonstop care package and airstrike glitches, ones we have seen since the early life of the series, are still in full-effect as well.  The single-player campaign is fun, at least telling a good story, but the real reason people buy and play these games is for multiplayer. If you are a PC gamer, I could not recommend this at ALL. Activision just straight-up doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about your gaming experience, and pretty much used the money they got to further-fund next-year's disappointment. One I will NOT be buying. Never again.  Mark my words, this is the CoD game that will kill the franchise. And at this point, given what we were offered in Ghosts, I don't think that's a bad thing.",-1,0

820082,209370,Analogue: A Hate Story,"I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this game. More important, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the concept. The game is spent going through dairy entries that are gradually unlocked with the assitance of a couple of AIs. It's a visual novel so you shouldn't expect too much of gameplay mechanics, but the game does ask you to navigate windows as if you were really remotely accessing the ship, and that little bit of immersion (along with the mid-game 'crisis' effects/gameplay) goes a long way in helping to tell the story.  Without spoiling anything: the story's setting is a bit weird, but it allows us to explore a more traditional, confucian society from the perspective of a more modern woman, along with how the various peole around her respond and their perspectives. It's interesting and, at times, heartbreaking. The storytelling is really well done so a lot of elements of the game (including the endings) can be interpreted differently.  It's short and enjoyable. Give it a try if you enjoy visaul novels or just enjoy good stories and have a couple hours to blow. 10 dollars is a bit more than I would pay, but if this is your style of game or if it goes on sale then give it a go!",1,0

822273,209670,Cortex Command,"Cortex Command is a game I have been following for a long time. It has always been a fun toy to play around with but has gotten a lot better recently. Gameplay is fast paced, entertaining and often leads to hilarious moments such as shooting a dropship down only for its engine to shoot off across the map and brain one of your actors.  Now to be honest its a bit of tricky game to deal with sometimes. Controls are strange and not always very responsive. It can be very hard to get your actor to go exactly where you want to go. Shooting on the other hand feels good and has satisfying results.  The campaign is a bit of a mix bag. It is nice as a framework to play the individual matches but has some curious game design decisions. If a player doesn't get a base straight away they will usually get left behind permanently in the game. Building up the bases themselves can be tedious, impossible or completely hands off, depending. You can have the computer design the base for you at which point you will have to deal with a base layour you don't know. Or you can design the base yourself which can be fun the first few times but after the tenth base can get very tedious. And sometimes the last isn't possible because the fog of war wont have lifted on the map so you wouldn't be able to see where you are placing the base modules (Although this might have been fixed now).  One of the best things about this game though are the mods. This is a game that is very easy and fun to mod. It is quick and easy to come up with new guns and troops to make your own faction in the game. Not to mention the plathora of great factions and maps already out there.",1,0

Getting the 'Endgame' achievement is half the experience and should be a significant milestone for many. You can comfortably put this game and its myriad secrets to rest at that point. I reached this in ~20 hours with half a stack of post-it notes and my favourite image editor to draw over screenshots.  Casual to moderate puzzle solvers should enjoy this first half of the game, the remainder of which is balls-to-the-wall insane.  The $40 price tag will not be justifiable to many. Personally, however, it more than earned its stay.  I would recommend giving this a shot anyway, and take advantage of the Steam Refunds feature if you're not getting any satisfaction after the 1 hour mark. In order to maximise the likelihood of enjoying this game, please relax. Know that if you are ever stuck, you can always set the game down and have a break, and have the solution spring to your mind the next time you sit down to tackle it, or journey to an unexplored part of the map and find another puzzle to crack.

845145,210970,The Witness,"It is shocking how much this game sucks. Like a 40$ maze book with some art that has nothing to do with the 2d mazes that are the entire game. Also no story. This game is 3d for no reason and it is sad how popular it is even though it has essentially no real game content and a bunch of irrelevant art.  I wonder if Johnathan Blow realized he would never be able to get physics into his engine so he fell back to simple 2d mazes. He could've made this in unreal in maybe 2 years max, and if it was just the mazes then 2 months.",-1,1

846055,21100,F.E.A.R. 3,"This is a bad shooter that barely belongs in the F.E.A.R. storyline. The second game was tolerable and even good at points but this one makes you wonder why you're not just doing anything else instead. The second mission felt like a bad rip-off of the favela fights in a much better FPS game, and the constant pop-ups for minor achievements are incredibly irritating. For what should theoretically be a relatively slow-paced shooter with bouts of action this one misses the mark completely, and it even throws in regenerating health to hammer the point home. It's like the difference between the Pripyat levels in STALKER and in Modern Warfare - despite having similar themes the feel of them is completely different. This feels barely like the second game and nothing at all like the original. After the favela mission I looked at the 'Challenge board' and the 'target time' of the mission and decided that it wasn't worth continuing. If I hadn't gotten the game as part of a cheap bundle I wouldn't have even bothered getting that far. I feel sorry for anyone who paid full price for this.",-1,0

847657,21100,F.E.A.R. 3,"Good for a quick romp with a friend, but sacrifices its horror for cheap thrills and explosive action. F.E.A.R. 3, I feel, suffers from a sort of identity crisis. It is built in a way that suggests it was meant to appeal to numerous crowds, resulting in a game that is a jack-of-all-trades. It isn't particularly good at anything, but isn't particularly bad either.   The campaign, suffering from a story that goes in far too many directions, shifting from tonally disturbing to joyously outrageous, is incredibly disjointed and is marred by shoddy writing and overacting. It feels like it should be campy, but I'm under the impression the game wishes to be taken quite seriously. In the beginning and end there are levels that capture the stakes quite well and have an immersive horror atmosphere, but this is broken to pieces by the Michael Bay-esque action in the middle of the story. It's difficult to determine when you should be turning your brain off and when you should be paying legitimate attention. The dynamic of the two protagonists is a very intruiging idea, but the game fails to represent its own ideas, throwing out the potential for a psychologically disturbing plot and instead diverging with bombastic action (including, no joke, mechs).  Levels are quite boring, shifting from department stores to airports, and a large majority of enemies are agents with guns. The action, in these segments, is quite good, even if there are few weapons to choose from. Both protagonists have different playstyles, so there is some value in replaying this four hour campaign.   Co-operatively there is some competition in gaining more points than the other player, along with the ability to 'steal' points from the other player. It is an interesting factor, one that could lend itself well to the rivalry between brothers, but the main protagonist is a silent one. The only banter you will hear is from the secondary protagonist, the dead brother. It would be one thing if the main character expressed himself verbally in any other way, but he does not. He keeps the same angry face throughout the entire game and fails to utter a word. This, in my opinion, is the biggest mistake of the game.  TL;DR This is a really stupid game, but it could make for a fun evening with the right person. I can't recommend playing it solo, so this is best played with another person who has a sense of humor. No matter how hard the game tries, don't try to take the game seriously; you will be disappointed. Instead, enjoy it for what it is: a fragile mess of a game with a few cool tricks and a penchant for changing its tone on a dime. If you see it for under $5 and have a friend to suffer with, give it a go. Otherwise, this game is best left on the shelf.",-1,0

The plethora of bugs I could live with - you can always restart a level after a game-breaking one and try again - but the unresponsive controls just make playing way too painful.  Player character almost never seems to do what you command it to, which is kinda shame as this should be a platformer. Levels are few, short and easy, and the story does not keep you interested for long. The only challenge comes from the difficulty of controlling the avatar, but boy does it make this game tough.

863137,211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"What if I told you there was a game that was a perma-death RPG with a rich lore and a difficulty that punishes you for having lack of skill? Well, this is it. Dark Souls is definitely for those who want to play single player with a hit of multiplayer WITH STRANGERS. Don't expect to be summoning in your friends in very easily. With a linear story line with different paths to get to bosses (even the order you kill the bosses is optional for some), and with all the different builds you can choose you will find a lot of replayability. It can be frustrating to be stuck on a boss for an hour or more, but the extasy felt after winning that is undescribable. By yourself or with some Jolly Cooperation you can spend time having some awesome adventures!  P.S. I ignored this game at first and I'm sad I did. If you give-up/rage-quit you're already playing into the games story. You sir/m'am just hollowed. Think about that for a bit.  Pros:     Excelent SinglePlayer Experience     RPG style leveling up      $5 (When on sale $20 normal)     Intuitive linear environment lead you subconsiously the right way     Difficult, but in a good and rewarding way     Different endings depending on path taken after a certain boss fight     Gamepad suggested (however, I'm a rare keyboard only player. So ha!)     Very large ammount of items, bosses, enemies, and exporing for increased replayability     DEEP Lore in the game (Can be ignored if you feel like it. . .)  Neutral:     Non-Spoon-fead story inducing mystery and YouTube Lore vids (    Click Here For Lore    )     Limited multiplayer (It works fine. Just hard to get specific people in)     Sequal game currently out  Cons:     Difficult and time consuming. If you don't like dieing then give up and hollow already.     Bad PC Port from console. Go and get 'DSFix' online to make it better.     Difficult at first due to not understanding the controls very well     PVP invaders can cheat.

864148,211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"Welcome, to Jolly Adventure's in Lordran. There's a lot to be said about this imperfect case of gaming perfection. So a 2016 review is due. All in all, a future classic.   Prepare to die as the Sean Bean, or at least as much as Sean Bean, the Chosen Undead, a mute man who dies again, and again, and again, on his obscure quest of physical and psychological self harm. Masochists and Sadists everywhere will rejoice as they invade and are invaded by a community of happy sun praisers. Crawl, scream, rage, cheer, and wake your entire household at 6:00am because you managed to finally kill Donkey-Stein and Shrek after two days of crushing controlers, keyboards, and mouses alike. Truely a game you will learn to love as much as that girlfriend you got a week ago, because Dark Souls has given you more testostrone and confidence than both Chuck Norris and Dwayne the Rock Johnson produce in a life time. Remember, real men play Souls. Real men eat a daily bowl of industrial nails with crude oil. Real men get the humanity.   Graphics wise, this game is pretty gosh darn pretty for it's time. Overall it's a decent mix of beautifully sylized, immersive and grossly incandescant.   The Music is like a sad chior at a funeral for all their collective grandmas and puppies. All in all it's pretty good granted you like dramatic, goth orchestras.   The lore is like the music. . .  The tale of Dark Souls makes Shakespear seem like the happiest man alive who wrote tales of sunshine and prosperity. To access this grand story, collect every item, read like a college student going for a law major, and have a good imagination.   Battle through a Peacful land with Kind Inhabitants all for a fluffy tail dagger. (forgive me sweet girl) Spoon feed Humanity to a Blind, Sick, Cursed, Fair Lady (Sob). Kill the Best NPC ever, the Chewbacca to our Han Solo. Name your next dog Sif. See onions differantly forever. Dark Souls teaches you that neither gameplay nor life are fair.   On to Bosses, the imfamous bosses that give Souls it's rep.  Be awed by their majestic intros and cool designs - about once, until you get tired of seeing Manus grab you off a cliff sixteen times in a row.   There's the Reskin trio, baby reskin, the bigger one, and then the one who decided to light himself on fire. Plunge attack practice,  Gargoyles-do-Ganks@gitgud.com , moonlight mothra, nightmare fuel face, a victorias secret model fused with a kaiju or somthing, Iron Tarkus FTW, Fluffy Souls Waifu 1.0, Breaking Bad the Dragon, Family Fued and the Human centipede, The Skeleton wearing skeleton and his pack of skeletons, Hellkite Bridge, A Really Angry Tree, Four Cancer Patients in Space, The Obligatory Trap (thank you japan), The Rock and The Hard Place, Havel the Rock (why the heck not?), (Kirk, dude, we are literally in the same covenant? WTH man?), My Dog Sif, Identity Crisis in The Sanctuary, Black Dragon Calamity, I Used to be A Great Adventurer Until My Arm Broke, Our Super Great Granddad the Psychopath, and of course Gwyn Lord of Sunlight, Lord of Anor Londo, Father of a Hot Chick, A Lack of Historical Annals, and a Trap W/Snake Legs?(WTF?), and Final Boss of Dark Souls  Overall it'll change your outlook on life and video games once you finish. Every other game you play will feel slightly more entertaining than your child's baby rattle. Just be ready to walk away with a minor or major case of PTDSD, or Post Traumatic Dark Souls Disorder. All boxes are mimics, all doorways are boss fogs, water bottles are Estus, check your day clothes for proper weight count so you can fast roll, fast roll across the street to avoid the sens fortress cars, hoard an impractical number of rings, and confuse your family as you try to kindle the stove. 9.8/10.

Failure is punished rather harshly but it does not make the game impossible. It instead forces you to learn from the mistakes made so you can become a better player. The community is great with very active developer support. The game is playable solo albeit more difficult (which is part of the fun!) but it really shines in multiplayer. The story is catching I find and overall rewarding to see all the way through.  The crafting system is where I had some frustrations due to limited carrying/storing space. It is not that bad though once you can move up the tiers of gear you use allowing you to free yourself of lesser materials. The game takes patience and should be expected to be a challenge.  One thing I have not tried a whole lot of is the PVP game mode. It can feature up to 8 players with two teams of 4. It is fun but with my limited experience in this particular mode that is about all I can say on it.  This game is for those who want that challenging arcade style feel with high score leader boards. Those that like to button mash so they can run and gun are probably going to feel lost.",1,0

You will play as Garrett (master thief) who will get in areas where thiefs arent very appreciated, so stealth and shadows are his best friends along with some special equipments that he owns. Combat is quite clunky and Garrett isnt exactly your swordsman but he got bow which helps alot in challenges that will come. Took 20 hours for me to complete this so it has good hours for single player game from my view. Because of difficulty settings you will get more hours in this game to spent.  8/10  Great  - Garrett - Bow and its different arrows - Gadgets  Good  - Most missions - Difficulty settings (harder difficulties give more objectives to do or obey) - Stealth system - Enemies  Bad  - Bit clunky combat - objective text didnt update with information that npc's gave - Mage towers mission",1,0

The gameplay is decent but repetitive and strangely balanced, such as eng-game materials costing a measly 600 pixels.  I like this game. I like it a lot. But it was given a full release that's not worth the money. I bought this game in beta thinking it would be good, something special. I am sorry to announce I was disappointed.  But hey, other people might like the story and find the programming issues tolerable. I'm not content with the mediocrity presented to me as a game, however. A full release of a game shouldn't have so many technical issues, and if those weren't present I might pass it off as acceptable. They are here, however, and given the game in it's current state I can't recommend it.",-1,0

889559,211820,Starbound,"I really wanted to like this game, I've been looking forward to its release for quite a while. I have played in early beta and soon after they added the Outpost. But I just feel the progression is too slow and too linear. In past versions of the game you could be out exploring the galaxy pretty soon into the game, but now you have to do a lengthy series of mundane quests involving scanning objects and getting to the end of a tedious handcrafted dungeon.  The game is hampered with a boring main quest about Earth being destroyed by a giant space monster. Even if you are a native of another planet, it starts you off as a graduate on an Earth academy, This means you character is not a blank slate but is instead an Earthling most likely. Even if you skip the tutorial you have to sit through a long cutscene once you have reached the outpost where an old lady tells you about the fate of Earth (I don't care about Earth, I'm a beep boop alien robot for the Creator's sake!).  The game shows you everything you can craft so far, even if you don't have the materials. This is pretty good, plus mining and exploring the planet is fun, even though the lack of randomly generated monsters does hamper the sense of danger and caution when exploring a planet. However, movement abilities are pretty weak, you get a dash after you give the Outpost tech-guy 10 copper bars, however this dash is barely a metre in distance and has a long cooldown. You can upgrade this dash to an air dash but this is also pretty weak in comparison to other platforming game's movement options.  It took me a very long time to repair the FTL, which requires the completion of the linear dungeon I mentioned earlier. I am still gathering resources to be able to breathe on the moon, so I can mine it for FTL fuel to actually use the FTL. This progression is really slow and I don't like being stuck on the starting planet for that long, I have already explored all of its surface and the mine area. To get the best gear you have to complete these scanning quests to populate the Outpost with more NPCs, these scanning quests require traversing the galaxy hoping to find items of that race, you then repeat this for every race and call it the main quest.  Overall I can't really recommend it as a game you open up, sit down and explore,craft and mine in. The open end sandbox of the game comes after an extremely long series of quests and you will be stuck on your starting planet for a while, so you better like mountainous green planets because you will have to stay for a while.

889657,211820,Starbound,"Disclaimer: this is my first review, and the reason I'm writing this is that the line between 'good' and 'bad' game is not so visible to a person who is not familiar with Starbound, and therefore I feel obligated to end my juorney with Starbound like this.   Overview   Starbound got into Early Access in 4th of December 2013. Before that, the lead developer Tiy had formally announced Starbound in February 2012, and a kickstater-esque pre-order opening was launched on April 2013. Starbound was released on 22 of July, 2016, when it had been on development for over five years.    Synopsis   Starbound sets you up in a planet with no other resources except your ingenuity and a Matter Manipulator, a clever tool used to harvest wood and ore for your use. As you get familiar with the crafting, you notice that the interface is a bit clunky and finding what you'd like to make gets harder as the game progresses and you are given more crafting recipes. The planet you're on contains many secrets, such as dungeons and chests for you to explore. The procedural generation gives a noticeable difference to all planets, and even though certain biomes on different planets look the same, there is a difference in my opinion. After you have explored the planet you're on, you can teleport back to your ship and find a new planet in your current system, or use space fuel to travel into other systems. As you progress, your stuff gradually gets upgraded from medieval style to sci-fi.   The game progression   Starbound has many different resources obtained trough different ways, like farming and mining. Although all the planets are beatiful and have something to explore, the player wants to progress in the game; getting better armor and survival gear is necessary. However, once you notice that making some armor requires cotton, your nice and perilous adventure in the planet's core isn't as nice as it was. It's good that Starbound doesn't hold hands on telling you where to find certain items, but that brings me to one of my strong points on my critique: exploring isn't fun if that exploration doesn't guarantee you to progress, and on the other hand progression is meaningless if nothing changes. Unfortunately Starbound achieves both of these bad points, even though it seems that it tries so hard not to.  There is no guarantee that a dungeon has something rare for you, or if it does, it's stuff like one or two pieces of matter manipulator modules. Which you need a lot more if you hope to upgrade your manipulator. On the other hand, when you find your items you need to progress, you're thrown into more dangerous planets but the premise is still the same: find out what stuff you need to upgrade your crafting stations, dig deep, don't die. Return, notice there's a resource you need but don't know what that is, get frustrated. Also, building shelter / a fancy house to yourself serves no use, as you need to switch planets to progress; meaning you need to bookmark that planet to return to your nice dwelling.  Starbound tries so hard to not be repetetive it's almost funny. I understand that these procedural concepts are really hard, but that is not an excuse if you have five years to polish your game.   Development   The story of Starbound is like a children's fairytale to indie developers. There's the good things, the bad things, and the moral of the story. The good things in my opinion are the promising setting, full mod support and enough customization to feel that you are truly unique.  The bad things: Let's just say that I don't want myself to get cencored by Mollygos or Tiy. There is evidence of that, there is evidence of Tiy shilling the game in reddit with alternate users, there is evidence of people getting banned in the official forums for asking how their product is progressing. I strongly suggest every reader to dig bit deeper into this, it's actually pretty funny how this thing was managed. Like the combat system was revised at least three times. Also, the design failures that had been reflected to Steam include a period where Starbound had not had a patch in one year. When Starbound was in Early Access. The excuses to this include stuff like moving into an office in London and what have you. Some games stay in Early Access for a year and they get released. Starbound was in early access for almost three years.  The moral of the story is that you should respect your playerbase, keep your promises especially if you receive money for a product that doesn't exist yet, and that doing freelancer work without any guarantees is a coin flip. I do not personally feel this way, but Tiy has been described from various sources as being 'egomaniac'. Take it as you will.   Should you buy this game?   If you like repetetiveness, go ahead. If you like illusion of progression, go ahead. However, Starbound is still to me an unfinished product with broken promises of features, and most likely will be forever. My own personal opinion is that you should not buy this game, or any future titles from Chucklefish without those titles being of exceptional quality, and nominated for Game of the Year in mainstream reviews.",-1,0

That said, let's go on with the review.  Imagine Starbound as a low res version of No Man's Sky (if we were to say that NMS came out.) Except it's focused on survival and not just crafting, trading, sculpting, etc. There are boss fights and 'modern' dungeons via quests. There's a storyline on who your character is/are. It's a RP game, as much as it is a sandbox game, a 2d shooter, and an adventure game.   One of Starbound's key faults is not building on the RP sense of things. It has not bothered me much, but if they did implement the character building, it would be a good game   The game is officially good. Buy it. Do it.   Updated Review:",1,0

926841,211820,Starbound,"Has no other choice rather than to compare this one to Terraria. Controls... are awful. Inventory window place is not remembered, crafting is long for no reason, even ladders are easier to use in Terratia - just hold down while running to a ladder and you won't climb. Monsters are 'different' but they behave in exact same 3 attack patterns, all planets are the same, absolutely no reason for plyaer to dig - just sack every settlement you encounter to collect ore and bars. Basically, everything you read as 'boring' in No Man's Sky - applies to this game perfectly. It's been in 'Early access' for ?3 years? I'd say it is still of the same quality. The only good thing about this game - dungeons, undiggable levels where you need to kill a boss. But unlike other platformers - everything between those bosses is boring as hell.  PS: Forgot to mention - 'Survival' mode means you need... to eat some food from time to time. That's it. And you can eat almost anything. Especially fun since there is no reliable pause.

927515,211820,Starbound,"I have my early access review below, quoted. I had suggested the game then. Times changed, development created frustration, and then when it launched it did so at a cheaper price than we paid for early access.  If I had it to do again, I wouldn't buy the game.  'I have been told it's very similar to Terraria, but I have no experience with that game and only a small amount with Minecraft. Why? These games bore me to tears typically. I get on, play for 20-30 minutes and then lose interest in them. Nothing usually catches me.  But yet the early beta of Starbound has been exceptionally fun to me. I'm not really sure which point appeals to me the most, so I'm going to just discuss the parts that I enjoy.  The first one is the variety of species, both for your own character and as inhabitants of the various worlds. It's fun to run into an Apex (Ape People) science facility on one planet, then stumble into a prison on another with every species you can think of held captive. And that's not even including the wide array of native animals you find on every planet. I've yet to see the same exact alien on multiple planets that wasn't a major species of humanoid.  Another interesting aspect is that you can travel all these worlds, with each one being different in one way or another. Exploring them, harvesting on them, hunting on them. And then just return back to your ship whenever you're on the surface from any part of the world by simply having Scotty beam you up. (Disclaimer: It's not actually Scotty, but we can pretend.) You can decorate your ship (And they are working on adding ship customization due to the popularity of the ship customizing mods that are available) and turn it into a mobile base of operations, a home, a giant storage facility, whatever.  The downside is the way that advancement is basically throttled by boss fights. You can gather and create a ton of things, but eventually to advance to the next tech tier you have to build a specific boss summoning item from your current tier. Defeat the boss, get their drop, and use it to create the next tech tiers item and advance forward. I hate this aspect because it takes away a lot of control in a sandbox experience.  With things like building your own Mechs, customizing your space ship, and flying hoverbikes on the horizon? I'm excited to see the beta advance further. But be warned! The game is currently wiping characters in the early beta, though that won't be lasting much longer.'",-1,0

A lot of this game's length comes from these unnecessary clicking orgies, and it gets boring fast. The interface isn't rewarding enough for you to grind your way to the problems' solutions.

931078,212070,Star Conflict,"I enjoyed this game to the point when i ran into the 'buy more ships' ranking system. Not only does this game force you to essentially play all 3 races in order to get race tokens to upgrade with (or wait and hope for a kit to drop) but also it makes it mandatory for you to level up other ships just for the sake of advancing your choice of role.  In essence: You want to play medic (engineer)? Sure son, level up heavy, sniper and spy for it. So not only do i have to level up the synergy of the engineer branch, but hey, just to make sure you play for a long long time: Level up EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE AT ALL TIMES, because thats how you advance your one single chosen role.  I like the game, good graphic, enjoyable battles, good weapons, interesting ship tweaking and so on, but leveling up a branch is hard on its own. The moment you understand that you basically need to level up everything: Its gone. There is in no god damn way enough diversity in this game to justify 999999999999999999 hours till you max out basically everything, and then we still didnt speak a damn thing about rare crafting mats and what not.

We all know that the Sonic team likes to do so much meth, but this time they really work hard on this title. Every map is well designed, every character haves his styled veicle and every music fit his game's map.  The poring of this game into the PC is not one of the best, but after some minutes of game, you will learn how to drive those frikin' veicle with no problems at all. The original thing that really impress me is the fact that the maps change every lap, they're not static, but interact with everything that is goin on in the background.  But there are some problems, and some of those are ridiculous. Some model's eyes... they are staring at me.. REALLY THEY'RE ♥♥♥♥ING SCARY. Did they forget to give them some eyelids?! And the most stupid thing I've ever seen: Sega actually paid some companies for add their characters, and they decide to voice acting them selfing, giving us stuff like a tf2 Pyro who mumbles like he's (she's?) suffering the pains of hell (you see what I did here? No? k.) Last thing that kinda bothered me, was the decision to create extra maps that are actually maps already in-game, but mirrored. They really had to?

944819,212680,FTL: Faster Than Light,FTL is an excellent example of how difficulty can be fun. I won't say that FTL is for everyone. It can be mind-numbingly difficult at times. It's the kind of game where you will play it for 20+ hours before your first win. On easy. The complexity and counterplay between making a decision during a battle and making a decision on what to buy or which beacon to explore leaves you with a rich gaming experience as each of these decisions can impact your attempt overall.

Fans of 'Dwarf Fortress', 'Nethack', 'Dungeons of Dredmor', 'Binding of Isaac', etc. might like 'FTL'. The game could use some kind of content patches or DLC but the modding community is very active. I've read that the developers are working to make modding easier and hopefully they will integrate Steam Workshop as it would work perfectly for 'FTL'.

As a player you do not actually fly or maneuver, but instead jump from location to location. This lets you focus on the inner workings of your ship, which is what the game is all about.

991209,214360,Tower Wars,"This game is different from other tower defense games since it lets you defend AND attack at the same time. That's about it's only advantage.  This game is below average at best. It is lacking balance, polish, it is lacking interesting upgrades, lacking transparency in numbers and stats on towers. What is the exact damage of my towers? What is the exact bonus against so and so? The game tells you nothing about the details, which is a shame considering most people who play this genre are people who like number crunching and optimising, and this game won't let you do so.  But mostly what kills it for me is the lack of a 'goal'. Lack of that sens of 'am i doing good or bad? how good I am doing?'. The single player missions seem pointless, as the game does not tell you how other people did, and gives you no score or achievement to aim for. I played the first level for an hour, survived everything and upgraded everything, yet i felt like i wasted an hour... What was the point? Againt you can't compare your performance and have no point of reference, so the whole thing is an exercice in futility no matter how well you do.  It seems the developers want you to jump into multiplayer and go against other people. But I do not believe that the system is robust enough for multiplayer, the upgrades, towers, stats, units, nothing seems optimised, balanced, or even transparent in what it does and that is really unatractive for someone looking for a competitive game.  Since the game is not transparent in its stats, it forces you to read guides and spend time on the forums, instead of simply playing and thinking / figuring out things for yourself (which i find is the most enjoyable aspect of tower defense games : number crunching), since i can't number crunch here i'd rather uninstall this game than rely in the community to tell me what is good and what is not. Seriously what would be the point of adopting solutions designed by others? You'd just be a bot running the cookie cutter solutions of another, instead of figuring out things for yourself. Not my idea of fun.  All in all this is a tower game with a single innovative feature, but seeing as it does neither single player nor multiplayer well, there is no reason to buy it unless it gets heavily patched.   Also looking at the dozen people on my friend list who bought this game, i don't see anyone who played this title for more than 2 hours, which reinforces the idea that this game is not very fun and offers very little bang for the buck.  Time to uninstall this and go back to Defense Grid.",-1,0

Add to that the fact that the game is based around sneaking and you don't have the comfort of hefting an awe inspiring amount of firepower, and you get to a whole new level. As the game states durring the loading screens, hiding is only a temporary solution. Dispite having numerous save stations and knowing your death is only going to set you back a few minutes, every time I saw that Alien come charging towards me, I had to scream. On top of that, the game designers seemed to take ungodly pleasure in making everything take more than a few seconds to acomplish. Waiting for an elevator or transport car while the Alien prowls around is unnerving, and just knowing that start uping a generator is going to bring the thing running is even more. There's also a fair amount of nostalgia to a universe that any Alien fan is familiar with. The flight recordings from the Nostromo had me right back in the first film.

1022358,214950,Total War: ROME II - Emperor Edition,"Feels like a Total War game. I'm not a huge fan of the series for a few reasons, but Rome II is still a good game. I havn't got that deep into the campaign, but I've had a few great matches. A few things that can be a little buggy, but no issues on the grand campaign yet.  To be honest lots of things I like better than Shogun 2. It's more polished in some ways, less in others. I can run it with a gtx 660 on max so it seems pretty well optimized. Rome 2 is geared more towards intel and I can notice how it loads faster and is more stable than Shogun 2 which was AMD focused.   But all in all still a good game, not my favorite RTS series but for what I paid it was worth it. I think I still might like shogun 2 a little more, but it's been out longer and it's aged well. Felt the game needs a thumbs up. But I got this after several patching and the campaign feels good so far, multiplayer is more active but less purpose. I like some of the changes they made from previous games. I feel there has been lots of work put into it, and more still that needs to be done. But it's deffinitly playable. If you like total war games, (which this deffintly isn't much different than any other TW game) You'll probably like this one. Shogun 2 with shields and no guns pretty much.",1,0

Rome I Was so good! why did u have to change it? all we wanted was new graphics. maybe some new action packed / Random Twists during gameplay. but in all.. we just wanted an updated Rome 1 !!  some people still prefer rome I over Rome II - How does that make u guys feel? Spent countless hours, and millions/billions making 1 'Grand' game.... and it has so many flaws, that the community slamed it to the ground before ever reaching 2 weeks of release... i've not recommended this game to anyone, and had i known how broken i was. i would never have preordered 2 copies... i was ashamed to have bought a new pc, and taken 2 days of work. so I could play what would have been the greatest gaming experiance for me, since i play wow for the first time...   Total war has allways been my favorit kind of games.. but i can honestly say i will rather do the dishes then start up a game of Rome II   and dont even get me started on the Multiplayer part, the ONE thing that made Total war SO awesome... and one is stuck in load time 90% out of the actual game play....

1025119,214950,Total War: ROME II - Emperor Edition,"It's much better than what it was at launch. I've been enjoying it alot more with mods. I would say the longer you can wait the better the game will be as there are still issues with it. Thankfully CA have been very good patching it since launch. For example the internal politics is flawed which wil not be fixed and the lack of polish or depth, streamlining the game play and limitations with the Warscape engine. Doesn't seem to be optimised for high end machines strangely enough. Though I find it very playable a 2.2gig Core2Duo with a HD4600 GPU which is near the minimum specs.  Alternatively Rome1 with mods still holds it's own for less and I just purchased Paradoxs EU:Rome Gold which has loads more depth although no real time battles. Both of these titles should be considered before you purchase Rome2.   I don't hate Rome2 far from it but at this stage it's not the best Total War title in the franchise  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I wrote that on 30 Nov, 2013  Now it is January 17th 2014  As of beta patch 8.1 I've recently come back to it using the DeI mod. Marked improvement with the patching but still alot of work to do to the game with various issues.   But it's miles better than what it was at launch.  For all its faults I do like it.   but do your research before buying and I still think the longer you can wait the better the game will be when you get it.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  2nd April  The biggest issue that still needs to be fixed is the ai attacking in sieges. It finds it really hard to do it properly. So waiting for a fix. The ai has a much better chance if you auto resolve otherwise it is an easy win for yourself if you play. Shame as it lets the game down. Puts me off buying any dlc campaigns regardless of whether they are any good.  At present the politics is just a balancing mechanism to revent a civil war. The civil war is not done very realistically as it is just a force that turns up from no where mirroring your forces in strength appearing from no where. The rebels contains no rival family characters who are still under your command in your armies. Abit of a game design flaw.  Naval combat has benifited from using mods to make it much more managable.  The recent addition of seasons has been welcome.  But it is a shame that what is good about Rome 2 is offset by what is negative. I do like this game but it could have been so much better. You can't patch bad game design",1,0

1036775,214950,Total War: ROME II - Emperor Edition,"Would I recomend you buy this game, no. Apart from the huge dlc content the game is poorly optimised. The game is at its peak about 2/3 hours into you're campaign. After that glorious period it falls victim to crash after crash after crash, even when i hover over settlements i drop down to 10 fps which just makes it unplayable. I bought the game at £7.50 and i wouldnt even pay that! If you try and use optinmising mods they dont help, i know because i have tried, sadly this game fell short just as it was getting intresting.  After more consideration and additional time spent playing this game i would recomend this game. The main reason for changing my opinion is defenetly the support of the community and how much creativity they have to include fantastic mods. With the additions of mods it expands rosters, have massive overhauls but the best part is you can pick and choose what mods you would like. This allows you to create the game you want to play not the bare bones boring campaign the base game offers, by having this ability to alter specific aspects of the game you dislike or further edit the parts you like instantly increaces the replayability by hundreds of hours. In a nutshell you can create your time period and story you wish to embark on and create a very additctive but fufilling game, definetly a game worth buying",1,0

Their support team is completely inaccessible. I cannot reach them in any way shape or form.  While some users are experiencing fluid gameplay, others like myself are experiencing major slowdowns and lag that causes them to miss jumps, sustain unpreventable/unavoidable damage, freeze outright, etc. My lag issues are primarily caused by intense CPU and RAM spikes coupled with disk thrashing with minimal background services and programs, leading me to believe the 2D MMO is somehow unoptimized for above-average laptops like a Lenovo G50 with an A8 processor and 6GB of RAM.  I've turned all of the graphical settings down, muted sounds, set the .exes to avoid advanced DPI scaling, ran the .exe in 8 bit color mode, tried numerous combinations of compatibility modes for Windows 7 and 8, and this machine is on a lean operation; all of its background services and running programs are cut down for efficiency and performance. My background is in IT. The game shouldn't be demanding half of my RAM on the lowest settings, it is 100% flawed optimization.  Again, warning users, the customer support is inaccessible.

1058730,217100,Dementium II HD,"The horror genre is dying, unfortunately, it's a very sad fact. Not only in cinematography, but in the whole industry of video games as well. The golden era of horrors is gone. It's been a long time since we've beaten AvP Gold on Director's Cut; discovered the horrible truth of the Covenant family; helped Torque make the right choice in the Baltimore County; saved Earth with Tommy Domasi; barely escaped R'lyeh with detective Jack Walters; fought alongside with young Simon through his darkest nightmares; survived Leafmore High School terror ... The list goes on, for each of us it's different, but we all have something to remember. I've never been to Silent Hill though. Yes, my bad, i regret it very much, too.   But now it's 2016 and i have nothing to play. It's not like i'm asking for a lot, no. Just a simple thriller/shooter. Maybe with a bit of a psychological horror and survival aspects. But i look at the Steam store and what do i see? Acidic pixel 'shooters' that have the highest ratings. 2-D Mario-like crap. Minecraft. Filled with agonizing pathos CoD games. Spoiled and ♥♥♥♥ed up AAA titles. All sorts of crap. Then i see something like 'A Horrible Horror of a Chainsaw Bloodshed Alien Killer Massive Massacre Gore Zombie Badass Shooting Shooter'. I click on it, expecting a nice horror at least, or a cool shooter. And what do i see? A pixel Top-Down game. With highest ratings. And then i realize, that this is it, it's all lost. The genre is practically dead. It's over. The plastic world has won. Noble metal statues and rose-wood masterpieces made with love and care and attention are covered in dust and left forgotten on the shelves of history. Soulless synthetic has replaced the creations of love, mind and talent obeying today's poor taste of a common buyer. The nowadays' generation doesn't need good action horrors, they don't want to be scared. They want to sit there and play addictive acidic ♥♥♥♥ed up ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tasteless meaningless stupid crap. Or pseudo-detective fashionable 'camera horrors'. Cheap jumpscares and nothing more.   Deep dark stories are not wanted anymore, they are not welcome in today's world. This generation doesn't want a dark action horror with a complicated character, they want simulators. Simulators of fishing, hunting, crafting, building, video taping, of taking a ♥♥♥♥. They are drifting out of touch, and it's more and more visible. Sometimes, very rarely, a single decent horror/action appears. Once in a few years probably. But rarely it happens, and even more rarely it's something playable and enjoyable. The latest one on my mind was Alien Isolation. A good, decent game. But i heard it didn't sell so well, so the sequel is under a big question.  Suddenly i feel scared. I drink, i drink more, i get almost drunk. I start Dementium II. I'm a patient in a psychiatric hospital that looks more like a prison. Guards bring in another inmate, the doctors in white robes discuss something. Are they talking about me? Suddenly i pass out. I wake up, i'm in a cell. Something's wrong, very wrong, the door's open. Why is the sky red? Why does that moving wall look like a giant guillotine? An ugly undescribable creature with a giant mouth full of sharp teeth run through the corridor. My inmate is delirious, looks like he's lost his mind. I grab a shank. The feeling of a weapon in my hand calms, even though i know i'm alone here, surrounded by monsters. I know what to do, i've been here before, walked these floors, i feel safe here within these ugly walls, surrounded by death, madness and misery. I'm ready, i feel good here. I'm home, again.

1058957,217100,Dementium II HD,"Dementium II HD is a PC port of a DS game of the same name, just without the whole HD thing, it claims to be a survival horror game and it succeeds in the horror part by being a clunky horrific mess of a game with very few redeeming qualities, but I am getting ahead of myself.  In Dementium II you play as William Redmoor, who has been locked up in an insane asylum presumably after the events of the first game, the game starts with you entering a nightmare world that looks like the offspring of Hellrazor and Silent Hill, and I will admit some of the designs of enemies and architecture are very well done and creepy.  Soon you meet a doctor who tells you about how they let out something from your mind and he's very sorry in the real world but in the nightmare world he's some insane man who keeps throwing monsters at you or... something... this brings up a major pain of the game's story, if you never played the first Dementium, and lets face it, you haven't, you will have no idea what is going on, why everything is like how it is, and who these people are, nothing is ever explained and even if you did play the first one I doubt the plot of this game would make any sense at all.  Combat is clunky at best, being a port of a DS game you can guess the controls feel weird, they are unresponsive at times and guns just seem to fire oddly, the gun sight is a little off to the right and moves with the gun, which I suppose is not really a negative given that most survival horror games have really bad combat anyway, but it also is not a problem because by the time the more powerful monsters came around I already had twenty or so healing pills, and this was on normal.  Quick side note on the sound design, it is really bad, enemies make the same sounds over and over, annoying chains clanking together or the odd skittering sound or better yet the very poorly done laughing sound the skulls make, and on top of that you will hear the same music for combat every... single... time... and it is really, really bad.  Overall this game took me about three hours to beat on normal and got all the achievements along the way, so is it worth it? No not really, the game is short, easy despite being clunky and a bit buggy, the plot makes no sense, dispite being 'HD' you can still tell it was a DS game, and even if some of the monster designs are alright you could just play one of the Silent Hill games and get the same effects wrapped in a much better package.  I never played Dementium II on the Nintendo DS where it was originally released, but after beating this version I looked up videos of it and that seems like a much better game... doesn't look amazing or anything, but better then this, and worth pointing out the original developers of this game did not make the PC port.",-1,1

Mostly because it's kinda newly released in Steam, but also because I've played it a lot with  friends the recent weeks.   Worms Armageddon is a game that's made to play with friends, if you have nothing to do between playing a game of CS:GO and are too tired to get back to your Campaign in Civilization V, than look at Worms Armageddon. With Worms Armageddon you can murder your friends with a Banana Bomb, or throw a huge metal Donkey on them.  The game has a wide variety with weapons, everything from MMA to rocket launchers.   If you see a worm on the edge of the beach, should you kill him with your shotgun or perhaps your grenade?  Or why not only stand beside him and push him into the water. (Protip: Worms can't swim)  The game is 2D and you can only walk to the left and right, and jump. There is a map creator so you wont ever  run out of maps, I can also recommend playing on an empty map, just try it, It's fun.  Either way, if you are bored and have friends, get this game, play it with them.   You won't regret it! (Hopefully)",1,0

Cons: - It is probably too easy to beat, just a bunch of algorithms to beat. - There's only one way to 'win' and that is pretty much going full 'social democrat', nothing else seem to work. - Very few scenarios. - The consequences of some actions are totally off, like raising VAT to 70% and seeing your opinion rating go up.  I truly like the idea behind it, and I hope the author gets backing to develop it into 1) a real game, made by pros and 2) a more realistic simulation, but as it is now I cannot reccomend it.",-1,0

1077330,218230,PlanetSide 2,"I'd only recommend for a VERY patient casual play. You will spend large amounts of time waiting, and waiting, and waiting for certain things such as:  1. Bug fixes. There are bugs/glitches/exploits that have been around for months if not years that still have not been addressed. Read some of the top negative reviews for a detailed look at some of the bugs (some are major).  2. Content and deeper gameplay. New content is released so sporadically that, if you decide to play, you shouldn't hold your breath for it. The gameplay itself is a team deathmatch grindfest for the most part. It's up to you and friends to create your own in-game goals in order to keep yourselves entertained.  3. Customer service. This was the nail in the coffin for why I finally stopped playing. There are currently so many customers in their support queue that they've disabled their online support chat and phone support number. This was stated by their own twitter account. At the time of writing this review (2/25/2015) there are several people tweeting to DaybreakHelp that have been waiting for WEEKS to even have their issues be heard. Some, like me, were having major issues such as not even being able to access their game(s). Instead of resolving any actual issues, people are simply receiving canned responses and having their support tickets closed.  It's worth checking out if you want something to play every now and then. The f2p model is actually one of the best out there. But given the fact that there's no real reason to stick around and keep playing the game, I can't recommend it.  P.S. Another major problem is H1Z1. I know, you're asking what H1Z1 has to do with Planetside 2. Well it's simple really... that is where Daybreak is focusing most of their attention now. With the 'restructuring' of the company, they are already spread thin on manpower, and now most of the staff is focused on their newest project. Going back to point 3... people are waiting weeks to even access their games/accounts, yet the VP of customer service is dedicated to chasing H1Z1 hackers.

1088345,218410,Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten," [UPDATE: Less-amateur art, less-trash performance... still just a clicker.]   Enjoyable at first, in the end, only tedious. No real challenge... or even tower defense.  Where most tower defense makes you think about how best to place towers and what to upgrade when, this game is completely stripped of thought. You learn the optimal locations for each 'tower' type early on, and, as evidenced by 'hero mode', the levels are almost all designed with a choke or two that takes full advantage of a single group's optimal patterns, so most levels play like this:  1. Plug one, rarely two, 'tower' groups into obvious optimal  sockets  locations  OPTIONAL: Spam archers 2. Upgrade (Mostly whenever, you'll have plenty of 'power'.) 3. WIN  The 'RPG' side certainly gives math nerds something to obsess over, but it's similarly simplistic:  1. Level up! 2. Damage +1  OPTIONAL: Reset points at any time, because you somehow screwed that up  That's it. You want your healers to heal, of course, (skip Holy Light completely) and to take advantage of each 'tower's' secondary effects, (armor break, chill, bleed, range, light/blind, devour) but for the most part, you'll just have to decide which usually low-end skill or two to neglect. Usually the lowest. You can safely ignore most defensive skills. (The actual numbers are utterly pointless because adequate info to calculate DPS and some secondary interactions aren't provided, and you learn how effective everything is by 'feel'/sight same as any TD game anyways... but don't tell the math nerds!)  And that's the game for you. The art is bland, the story is absurd, but occaisionally amusing. Nothing to see here. While not a 'worst game ever', if you're out for an actually good tower defense/game, look elsewhere. You might enjoy this if you're a math nerd, part of the Number Enlargement crowd, or just want something easy and amusing to click on and only plan to throw a few hours away with it anyways. Don't expect the game to get better as it goes on, it just doesn't. It never could, because it's fundamentally flawed.   [FOR OLD VERSION:]  Unfortunately, I have to add:  system requirements are a trollishly bad joke.  The game runs in Flash/AIR and suffers from the usual 'looks like an old DOS machine could run it/practically requires a super-computer' issues. On a less powerful CPU, it may take twice as long to get the same amount done, and you will lose input control if you button-mash the one spell you'll want to button mash. But don't worry, you'll only notice it at critical moments, and only cause you to lose your 'perfect' completion on a couple 45 minute boss battles... before you learn. Or your RSI flares up.",-1,1

1092597,218620,PAYDAY 2,"Short version. Has become a pay to win cash grab and has been getting there for a few months now.  Payday was a great game and Payday 2 expanded on that.  The first one was more of a L4D experience that was about holding a place and surviving. The second one added good stealth, and new mechanics (some are super over used, bag packing and throwing are the worst ofenders) But it was a legitimate good time and online was a blast always being 3 seconds away from being caught and seriously underspecced for a front assault. But then the DLCs started coming out. (You must know the first game had just one DLC pack that gave you a character, a weapon, some masks, 2 heists and some skills so real bang for buck there) At first the DLCs were not great but added some fun features and even some free stuff like the Diamond store and the infamous update. But then they decided that that was not enough and Started dropping 1 char, 1 mask and some skin packs sure not great but you don't really needed that character to get anything you could get a new Heist for the same Price. But then they decided that the best weapons were going to be in the new DLC packs, and to add injury they started 'rebalacing' the base and old DLC weapons, that meant that unless you wanted to be severely underpowered you had to get the DLC packs.  And now after saying that they would not add micro-transactions they did, weapon skins, doesn't sound terrible I mean CS-GO did it and that is a good game. Well not here the skins are not cosmetic, that means that after nerfing the weapons to insane levels (pistols being more powerful than shotguns) you can either buy DLC packs of non nerfed ewapons or pay to get skins that will get whatever level you already had.  That means a fun game just became a Pay to Win cash grab. P.D. Don't bother with the base game anymore.",-1,0
1092649,218620,PAYDAY 2,"They lied during preorders, didn't deliever at launch what they promised. Now over 2 years later, they still haven't. Just this week, they also decided to give their entie community the middle finger.  Historically their DLC model wasn't terrible, but it never addressed the missing promised features from prelaunch. There was an issue with it, DLC started to introduce power creep, you had to buy the latest DLC to beat the newest enemy they added.  The biggest draw for me to Payday 2, compared to the origianl, were the stealth options each mission was going to have. They've done everything they can to nerf that. First they force you to do missions without any stealth segments, or on multiday heists one part will be loud. Just to imply they support 'stealth gameplay', they give you tiny added experience bonus of completing mission without setting off alarms. The main point is, one way or another you're forced to buy those DLC guns. You'll need the DLC when the mission goes loud because they've nerfed stealth skills, or because one of the days doesn't have a silent option.  The DLC model wasn't terrible cost wise, within a month a they would have it available half off, and then 2-3 months later 75% off. This week they decided that wasn't making them enough money though...  During their 'Crimefest', which is an annual 'thank the community for all their support' they introduced paid guns. You now have to spend ~$2.50 per gun to get the best weapons in the game. Crimefest is supposed to be a week of some smaller free items, instead of their typical DLC pricing, but they gave the community the middle finger, again during their 'thank the community event'.  This wouldn't be so terrible, if this wasn't just another bullet point on items they completely lied about during preorders and launch. They have been stating for years they would never put microtransactions in this game, one price to get the full game, and occasional DLC. You can find interviews and event Steam forum posts by the developers up until a few months ago saying there would never be microtransactions. This update, first day of Crimefest, was nothing but implementing microtransactions into the game.  They've lied a lot, but this one took the cake, and I hope the community never forgets.",-1,1

This however wasn't that problematic. Recently they added 'safes' that drop randomnly, but can only be opened with 'drills' that can only be bought with real money.

1104235,218620,PAYDAY 2,"I really, really like this game. A lot. I feel that Overkill is one of the few developers out there that is pushing content on a regular basis in a good way to keep their game feeling like it's not getting old.  I like describing Payday 2 as 'Left 4 Dead, but where you rob banks instead of killing zombies.' Left4Dead gets boring really fast. Payday 2 does not.   HOWEVER.  I cannot condone the recent actions of Overkill, reneging on their promise to not introduce microtransactions into their game, reneging on the promise to have Crimefest 2015 be a big package of free content to players, and then on top of that not only introducing microtransactions, but stat-altering microtransactions.   There will be no compromises on this from me. Microtransactions must go -- if Overkill can break a long-standing and staunchly held promise to not introduce them, I can no longer trust Overkill as a developer to not go back on any other promises they've made.",-1,0

1104765,218620,PAYDAY 2,"This game, at release, was fairly fun. Over the months and years that followed, however, things got less fun and more expensive. With what seemed to be weekly DLCs that added masks and small heists for the totally reasonable price of 5 dollars, I started to lose touch with the game. With the recent controversy regarding Crimefest, it seems this game went from a group of friends stealing money from corporations and banks to a corporation stealing money from a group of friends. Unlocking content such as being able to buy keys to get skins that boost your weapon stats and the ability to filter out what type of games you want to play are something that should have either been in the game at the start or simply not at all. Promising the community a week of 'free content' and then giving them some paid content is a scummy thing to do.",-1,0

1109279,218620,PAYDAY 2,"You do not want to get this game. Everything is falling into shambles as the majority of the content becomes locked behind paywalls and other forms of malicious money-grabbing. The base content offers little to be desired, and any enjoyment you may gain from grabbing this game on sale will further be eclipsed down the road by their poor direction of game improvement.  It's only a matter of time before Overkill releases the game for free under their new micro-transaction policy (Mark my words on this), and on top of that I wouldn't be too surprised if they started selling one-time use contract offers ('Missions' in game) for real life money. Currently, you're able to gamble real life money on keys similar to CS:GO to get cosmetic skins--except this skins also impact gameplay through increased stats.  Don't have the DLC for the gun that popped out your micro-transaction safe? Doesn't matter; you can't use the gun until you buy the DLC. This type of practice goes directly against what was promised to us by the game's main producer back in 2013.  Seriously, I'm typing all of this out as a favor because I've invested probably well over 100 dollars into this game after discounts, and I'm absolutely disgusted.

There are some reasons.  I didn't play Payday since day 1. Actually, it's only my first year. I'm not a newcomer, alas not a stellar pillar of server, but I had the opportunity to meet the 'community'. 13 y/o brats. Yes, that's right, 13 y/o ragequiters, who'll kick you out of the game because you don't have the right 'skill build' (ridiculous, I mean, that's the way I like to play, and I succeed, so where's the problem?), they won't listen to you, they won't cover you, they won't help you, and at the end of the day, they'll point out that you were useless.  Unless they'll survive a Police Assault whilst repairing a drill. Yes, they do it together.  The other thing are the DLC's. Why is Overkill doing the same stuff as Dovetail Games? You don't know who they are, right... well, look up Train Simulator 2016. A vast part of weapons are DLC weapons, which are, of course, better than 'vanilla' ones. Some say that it's easier to play the game with DLC's. It's true. But they forgot to tell us that it's nearly impossible to succeed at DW heists with 'vanilla' weapons. Do YouTubers use 'vanilla' weapons? No, why would they? Nobody like to watch people lose all the time...  Payday was good back then. If you're a newcomer to this game, request a refund.

1130424,218620,PAYDAY 2,"Payday was a fun multiplayer shooter with aspects of stealth, micromanagment and weapon customisation which made it an entertaining, replayable experience. The wide array of heists and guns only furthers its replayability. I would have fully recommended it not too long ago. However now it comes with some stipulations. Firstly, going on public games is very hit and miss. Sometimes you can find good players who are kind and willing to listen to orders if they are logical and are patient with their teammates shortcomings. Other times, however, you can get hackers, mic spammers, new players, AFKs and often when joining a public game they will kick you as soon as you join because they are waiting for their friends and forgot to turn the game friends only. Secondly, the game costs $30 at full price but employs a almost free-to-play system of constant DLC with power creep. Most of the time its fine, because only the host needs to buy the heists for everyone in the game to play it and no weapons are in general overpowered but some DLC is almost necessary. If you don't buy the assault pack you don't get grenades, and several enemies seem almost impossible to kill without certain weapons like Bulldozers, Shields, Captain winters Etc. and make it hard to justify even playing without buying the DLC at all. This normally would be fine for free-to-play games because you haven't spent any money but this game costs $30. Thirdly In the recent updates weapon skins can have stat increases, which need IRL money to be purchased. This is in essence a pay-to-win feature. The stat increases aren't massive, but its still not an admirable profit venture. In conclusion I'd recommend this game if you have friends to play it with and don't mind spending a bit of money to increase your experience a bit.",1,0

But making all the Snipers, All the shotguns, All grenades, All specials DLC is just lame. Not to pricey though. Thats not why Im thumbs downing this game. I could deal with DLC and would even buy. But my main concern with the game is the skill tree. Its completely lack luster too me. Most the skills for all characters just arent appetizing. And really arent effective.

1160161,218620,PAYDAY 2,"NOT FOR CASUAL GAMER$S  I do not recommend the game even it is a great co-op game, not one of the best tho and the gameplay, drop in/out system is great too. but its not that perfect, it freezes randomly after missions and if you are a host it will disconnect everyone and will keep freezing as soon as someone tries to connect, on the end you have to kick it in the task manager, if this happens in a 3 day heist before last day you loose a lot of exp and money, very frustraiting.  Amazing game theme, really a lot of fun if no bugs/freezes appear, needs a good team coordination most missions are impossible to do by yourself if you are on a low level with only few perks, you need to be a good team player for this game.  Other thing i don't like is that the guns and upgrades are way too expensive forcing you to play some missions many times and it does get boring then as the revards are small if you don't rob everything that is not nailed down, but some missions even if you do rob all you see you still don't get much cash, doing 1 mission for 30 minutes to get 20k or 60k spending cash, its frustrating and thats why it gets boring rather quickly for some people and causual players if a rifle costs up to 700K.  This game quickly turns team play into rush for cash 'GRIND FEST' game where nobody cares about the other one, coz everything is way too expensive and you never get much cash, no wonder lots of people used cheats and hacks, who wants to play for a half year to have a fully upgraded M16???  I would give this game 50/100 coz of the freezing and there are not really that many missions so when you play repeatedly to earn enough to buy ultra expensive gear it suck and is boring, and the game is not at all made for a casual player but rather for people who play with their friends, a team of 3-4 everyday.

This game was once great, I spent plenty of hours on it, bought every DLC up to the sniper Pack, when I realized this has just become a game where all the free guns are bad, and if you wanted a good shotgun for one skill tree and a sniper for the other, you would have to spend 10$ just to get both, not including even more to use all the weapon mods for them. The final straw for me, was the Gun Skins. Nerfing the default guns, and gambling to get new ones is the worst idea I have ever heard, and it became a reality.

1165418,218620,PAYDAY 2,"If you come from PD:TH you will feel at home and get a sour taste in your mouth at the same time.While you had almost movie-like Heists where you felt like a well-organized crimecrew and everything was a unique experience in the first one,PD2 degrades you to low-tier crooks at times while serving you a lot of recycled content to fill the void that haunted the base game at release.  It got better and in its current state it is safe to say 'You will get a lot of fun for your money' but you should be aware that the game became a DLC fest and some of them are not worth more than 2 bucks (you might want to score them at a sale,if at all).However,you do not need to own the Heist DLC`s to play them so thats a big plus and should not lower your view on the Game itself.  Since the weapon dlc´s are optional and offer a wide range of useables,you can buy things you like and ignore the others without missing out on anything (there are a lot of weapons in the base game and you will not use all of them anyway).  Gather some friends for PD2 and enjoy the ride or just heist away and make friends while playing  Edit: Due to recent changes during the 'Crimefest' event,i have to change my review to reflect what happened to the game. The previously mentioned DLC-Fest got worse,while the Company tried to make the older ones fit into the theme of the game,the last DLC was 'Chivalry' themed and fit into the gameworld as 'good' as bringing a Bow,TNT and wild west themed guns into combat against Special Forces (which you can do,with the wild west DLC'.  If the target audience is meme-sputing 12year olds i would understand but this game wasn`t at release so it is safe to say that the quality degraded over time. What made me dislike the game as a whole is the recent addition of microtransactions to the game. Similiar to CS:GO,you can buy things to open crates (or safes in this case) and inside you find weapon skins that were made by interns or drunk regular graphic artists. Some people were asking for this feature to be added but with bugs from the BETA still beeing ingame and other design choices that should be changed before anything else, priority should be somewhere else. However,Overkill Software is good in playing the 'poor indie developer that is struggling to survive' card to justify selling the cheapest things in overpriced DLC or as of now, in a way F2P games need to cover the costs of hundrets of thousands of players playing the game.  As usual, the community voicing their opinion gets ignored professional (look for 'Your opinion. My choice.' to get an idea how things are handled at Overkill) and microtransactions are here to stay which made me dislike the game as a whole. At the end of the Payday2 Beta,the lead developers state that 'the game will not have microtransactions and shame on you for thinking that way' (you can verify this by a simple google search) and now the greed of everyone involved at Overkill got em to include it anyway.  Be sure to check out the discussion page where fanboy will defend anything that gets added to payday and be sure that these people wouldn`t stop complaining if you had to pay a monthly fee to play Payday2, if you are as blind as they are you can justify anything.  To come to an end here,the last question remains: Do you recommend this game?  In all honesty,i was about 55/45 during the writing of the first review because i disliked the moneygrabbing policy of selling everything as DLC and not having the decency to deliver this content without errors (several DLC additions were bugged,had clipping errors or were useless to begin with) but the game was still enjoyable with friends so o said 'Yes' back then.  With the add of microtransactions to a game that is still lacking things after 6 to 10 PAID DLC`s and has an average peak of around 6k players per day, i couldn`t make myself to recommend this game to anyone.  It was a good ride,fun while it lasted but greed killed it in the end.Do not buy if you value yourself and you wallet. Do not listen to promises made by anyone related to Overkill,they will tell you anything to get their hands to were your money is.",-1,0
1165430,218620,PAYDAY 2,Not worth the price. Terrible game. If you don't have a full team you won't win. The game encourages you to sneak but even the short easy missions will take a ridiculous amount of time to complete. You can easily just run in and start shooting and be done with the mission three times as fast. Horribly balanced. So glad I didn't got this on sale so I did waste more money on it. Also the game has no story making it extremely boring and it feels like you are doing the same thing over and over again. Do yourself a favor and buy something else. You've been warned.,-1,0

1170530,218620,PAYDAY 2,"Edit: Negative due to devs playing dirty pool. They keep adding more ridiculous enemies to unbalance the game and push people to buy DLC weapons, classes, etc. and now they're putting microtransactions in.   Payday 2, AKA The Gang that Couldn't Drill Straight  tldr: A reasonably good co-op game. A servicable shooter. A mediocre (at best) stealth game. Complete crap single player game, despite an 'offline mode' (can't carry two keycards? thanks devs). Worth it at 5-10$ as long as you're playing with friends (or want to play with randoms) but I wouldn't pay full price, and with all the grinding and cheap mechanics the game loves wasting the time of the player. Luckily it has regular sales. I was tempted to make this a negative review with the simple caption 'cheap-♥♥♥ cloakers' but I guess there's more than that.   Payday 2 is a game that wants you to fail. It's a game that tells you to play it your way; it whispers the promise that 'stealth is an option' in your ear. Don't trust it. At every move it will betray you.You'll set up your character, carefully select appropriate gear, recon the target, and move in with skill. And none of it will matter because some ninny that you couldn't have possibly known was there will walk around the corner at the wrong time. Maybe you deal with him, but then you need to answer his buddies on the radio. While you're doing that someone else comes around the corner. You shoot him but someone else hears it and within fifteen seconds you've turned what was supposed to be a quiet heist into a mass murder. Screw it, toss a grenade. The recriminations begin on whose fault it was. And this is how Payday 2 gets it's jollies.  Because the stealth system sucks and I don't think it's an accident.   Once you put your 'mask' on you can't take it off. You can't use any sort of disguise. When guards are killed or captured their radios will go off and must be answered within 12 seconds (immediately, but only once... and it stops working if you neutralize more than 4 guards). Line of sight is... questionable (as I mentioned, I've been spotted through solid walls and had a guard walk through one!). When you add these issues to the scripted added difficulties (took care of your four maximum guards? The game automatically adds another one to the map by magic, just for you!) stealth is not very workable in most maps, especially at low levels. In fact, stealth used to be more doable but the developers nerfed it. So why does Payday2 talk the talk about stealth but not do any real walking?  I think it's not just that PD2 wants you to fail at stealth, it NEEDS you to fail. Beyond the fact that it's engine appears not to be all that great at the mechanic, how many 4-player co-op games do you know where the point is to do almost nothing? I sometimes succeed at stealthing missions (solo and with friends) but after some point it's less 'tense heist' and more 'tedious drilling simulator'. I can only imagine how annoying it could be playing with random people and having to sit around for 10 minutes waiting for two stupid drills and then the time it takes to pick deposit boxes. I imagine playtesting revealed that the best way to play is to try and go 'quiet' and fail about halfway through... at which point the toys come out. And that's not the worst thing in the world. PD2 does a reasonably good job of going to action mode. Enemies aren't geniuses but the game uses slight of hand to make them challenging (allowing them to sneak in through inaccessible parts of the map, etc). Sure, it's insane that there is an army of FBI Swat members converging on every event but whatever. PD2 follows similar games like Left For Dead in delivering a fun (if uneven) co-op experience.  Some other Pros:  - Nice selection of weapons, most of which have a good feel to them - Has some nice (but complicated!) options to switch between skillsets - Mission generation lends replayability  - Nice trade-offs in equipment for missions ('do I really need that spear or can I go with something a little less attention-getting?')  - Lots of achievements, if that's what floats your boat  Cons - Poor voice acting, often verging on grating and self-indulgent. SHUT UP BAINE!  - There isn't much to play with at low levels  - Economy is broken / much grind. Much of the game is a poorly hidden money-sink. The mod system is nonsensical in many ways, like having to pay to 'buy' a silencer if you take it off your gun for a moment to see how a different one works (and you only get the chance to buy them if the random number generator at the end of each successful mission 'gives' you a mod instead of some stupid color scheme for a mask that would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to build).  - Special enemies feel very arbitrary, especially the inexcusable 'cloaker' mechanics where you often have no chance to stop them before you get knocked out. I know every game like this seems to have the same reskinned special enemies but I'm getting a little tired of it.  - Friendly AI is brain-dead. There should have been some simple commands included for playing solo (pick up bag of money so I don't need to make 4 trips, for example)  - Can't respec without losing massive amounts of money. The general moneysink problem is bad enough but this is really harmful to the early game where people are first learning how to use skills.  - Again, the stealth is purposely gimped and is poor. - The game loves to waste your time, and not in a fun way. It's just overly done here.   Obviously I've got some complaints about the game, especially the way the stealth has been handled. That said, it's definitely worth the price I paid ($6) to play with friends.",-1,0

Melee weapons and guns both have roughly the same effectiveness (excluding range) and enemies often outnumber you 15-to-one.  You will die. You will die frequently, and you will shake your head and think 'I KNEW I forgot to take that guy out.'

1205783,219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"As the name suggests, Chivalry is about medieval warfare. You are playing a foot-soldier from 4 classes of your chosing : archer, man-at-arms, vanguard and knight, EACH with unique weapons and pros/ cons. There are many game modes, classic team deathmatch, free-for-all, capture the flag, horde (zombie) mode, duels. My favourite is team objective, where each team competes for a series of map objectives (like raiding villages, conquering castles, assaulting forts and defending kings etc).  Chivalry will offer you a very satisfying time fighting with lots of weapons (swords /axes/ maces/ spears/ polearms/ bows/ crossbows, and many others) in 1st person or 3rd camera. 1st person camera feels like playing Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, for those of you who know the game. You can use different atack moves to kill your enemy, each with advantages and disadvantages. This game also features lots of gore, which is to my liking :warcry:, and you can also chop members off and decapitate enemies in killing-blow.  Graphics are quite demanding, but offers a nice degree of quality, even for 2016. The sound ambience and music is great, with voice acting even greater, and weapon sounds and clashes even much MORE greater ! You can also taunt and mock your enemies (which is a common thing in Chivalry and fun to do) and complement them via 'radio messages'  Combat, I would describe it as, straight from Dark Messiah, and even enhanced. Very pleasant to learn special moves and tactics like dragging etc.  Game is easy to play, hard to master ; it's easy swinging swords left and right, but to become a true sword-master ? Hah this takes time and thinking. But once you do become a veteran of this game, you will discover an immense pleasure in dueling with other high-level player and beat the challenge.  I am a true fan of this game, even before, I played a lot of Age of Chivalry, it's predecessor as HL2 mod. It's much more challenging and fun to play than other PvP games like Dark Souls or Mount and Blade.

Almost everything in chivalry is fantastic, theres something great about the whole experiance of cutting an opponents limb off and screaming 'FOR THE GLORY OF AGATHAAAA!' over his bloodied corpse.  The only downside to the game is the developers, torn banner, with every update they seem to break a critical game feature (Eg the entier ranking system being broken for a fair few months), which is a shame as it can make you stop playing the game for a long while and put you off it.  The only other annoyance is the community, often players can be very overly competative and immature, but i guess this is a given with most online games with lots of players.  Modes such as Duel and 3v3 battles are often much better in terms of players at they take a lot more patience and honour to play properly, i highly reccomend them.  My last point is to the learning curve of the game, there is a rank system to classify newer players from the more experianced, but due to the game having been out for a while, there are a lot of very good players which can put off newer players, however it is still often hard to have to take in scores of 3 kills to 30 deaths in a game, but its just down to practice.",1,0

The only negative comments I can make are around the occasional graphical glitch, the inconsistant bot AI which works well for certain types of matches but utterly fails in a number of objective based maps and the objective based matches can devolve into a boring waiting game for the defenders who's only objective is to defend until a timer runs out, being on the attacking side is invariably more interesting.  Overall Medieval is a brilliant multiplayer experience that raises the bar on first-person melee combat, even better when played with friends",1,0

Halt! Before you even think about it, I'd advise you to not purchase Chivalry. This game is riddled with bugs, and not the charming kind.   I'd say I have had success starting this game about 1/4th of the time, and once it's started you can't minimize it without a crash either. I wish this was the smallest of the problems.  Willing to put up with it? Combat is a joke. There is no directional blocking. You can swing in different seemingly directions, but all are blocked by a simple right click. You can only hold your block for a couple seconds though, or your tiny warrior arms will get too tired and have to let it go!   The customization is atrocious. You pick from a set of four classes and then choose a weapon. You can spend additional money to unlock different looking armors that act exactly the same as the class armors that you're stuck with in the first place.  I'll stick to Mount and Blade or War of the Roses.",-1,0

I remember when it came out I went nuts, and got it. I was so pleased with everithing, had sooooo much fun. But one day, an update came out..... The game was running badly even before, but It did not crash, now it started crashing every 3 matches UDK exe stopped working. I whouldnt know how to express my rage... but I still went on playing it! Even if it crashed and I had to wait for long loading screens! Before u start saying that I had a bad PC, My PC was matching the above 'recommended' requirements and that just says how BADLY the game is made and poorly optimized, then once in a while they whould release a new ♥♥♥♥ING wepon skin? ♥♥♥♥ING WEPON SKIN??!!!

It just says how torn banner treats this game and the licence..... there is 0 support currently and as I can see Torn Banner is trying to milk out some more money from the remainning player base with skins that are OVERPRICED. And so I got a really powerfull pc about a year ago so I could 'enjoy' more chaotic gameplay.

It, however, fails miserably. The gameplay style doesn't really seem to work very well for this kind of game. If you, like I was when I bought this game, are looking for big-battle sanbox style gameplay, I recommend you go take a look at Heroes and Generals, War Thunder, and, of course, Battlefront.

1225786,219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"You know, I like this game. Deep down, there's nothing more fun that shouting aloud and running into the fray. However, I had to agree with others that this game seems to have been produced, popped out and quickly forgotten by the devs. For example -- there has been a bug that shows all servers as full that has been around for at least two months, when they are maybe at half capacity. I would think 2 months should be enough time to fix this.  Specifically for the DLC -- If you liked the original Chivalry, then you'll probably get a kick out of this well enough, though I would not purchase it for more than 5 bucks. If you never played the original, then you may be frustrated pretty quick as the game does have a learning curve. However, there are balance issues among the various classes that can lead to that added contempt. Also, there are playstyle issues (example: using 3rd person and high mouse sensitivity) that allows people to move their player models in unnatural ways, making it less of a move/counter/riposte sort of fight and more of a fight of who can spin their screen faster.  So all-in-all, I wouldn't recommend this game unless you really enjoy the style. For the average gamer, take your money to some of the other games out there.",-1,0

1247925,219890,Antichamber,"Antichamber feels like the opposite of Portal, Quantum Conundrum and Q.U.B.E.  Those games make use of logical puzzles, Antichamber... does not. It will force you to think outside the box. And that is not an easy task for most of us.  The game itself consists of a mostly seamless world (until you get to a part where you're being forced to teleport out of it), with puzzles in every corner. Not all of these puzzles have to be finished for you to complete the game, but you do have to collect the 4 different guns in order to advance and finish the game. Once again, not an easy task.  I'd love to explain some of these puzzles to you but that would spoil them and it's too difficult to even try anyway. It's something you have to experience, if only for a short while.  Antichamber has another cool feature; the use of in-game achievements. The rooms use icons/pictures and text to act as in-game achievements. Seeing them lets you know if you've been there before and it might even give you a subtle hint on what to do. You'll have to solve every puzzle there is so fill up your wall.  It would've been nice if there were Steam achievements involved as well, but hey, you can't have everything I guess.  One annoying thing is that if you press Escape you have to start over if you wish to continue the puzzle you were working on. There's no pause button, if you press Esc you're back in the 'main menu' where you can select which puzzle you want to solve and see your achievements. Quite annoying if you want to take a little break.  Oh, as you may have noticed the graphics are a mix of simplistic, artistic and futurustic styles, and while they're not always hi def, they're cool to look at. It's really something special.  Hmm, I don't know what to say to you. I wish I could recommend this game to anyone out there, but I think it's a 'love it or hate it' game. As a game though, it's a success !  [Rating: 77/100]",1,0

But it's so bare bones in certain areas that I was absolutely convinced it was a poorly done mobile port until somebody corrected me.  What am I talking about? Dispite being a PC game first, it has no options menu of any kind, you can't correct the resolution, change the graphics (though I doubt you would need to) or even do something as simple as change the game volume. Distinguishing between the balls must be hell if you're colorblind, a menu option for that would have been really helpful for a lot of people. It does not lock the mouse to one screen if you have multiple monitors, but still requires that you move your mouse to the edge of the screen in order to pan the camera. It has no keyboard controls, even though it could have direly used some, such as the ablity to pan the camera with the arrow keys which would have delt with the mouse not locking issue, and a key for undo which would remove the need to click those stupid bugs (or more often, accidentally click one when you're trying to do a quick action).  Did I like it? I kept playing through the problems and beat it, so yeah I must have liked it dispite its problems. At the same time, would I recommend it? no, especially not at the normal $10 price tag.

1314735,220240,Far Cry® 3,"In short: open world, with nice characters, a lot of gameplay elements, unrealistic 'rubber bullet' balance, slight performance issues.  The game is not bad, but I have basic requirments for every FPS.  Clear controls. (Works OK in FC3) Well performing weapons (balanced visual and ingame effects). (nope) Challenging AI (atleast on high difficulty). (nope)  In Far Cry 3 the story is nonsence, but fun, so there's nothing wrong with it. Where the game gets wrong is basic mechanics. And if you don't care about them, then you will like the game. But I can't enjoy the game because the silly story and exploring doesn't motivate me to keep going with help of lame made weapon balance and AI.  Weapons are well animated, have impressive sounds, visual interactivity, but their damage and fire range are not impressive at all. They are simply way too ineffective compared to what they look like. Disappointing. Balance? I tell you that: it's hard to make a game where balance will be fun and make sence at same time. So Ubisoft went the easy way: made fun balance. So you're welcome in close quarter fights with assault rifles, 15 meters crossfires with SMGs and point blank shotgun meat-o-mation. That lame stuff doesn't impress after the original Far Cry where weapons weren't looking so good, but atleast had fire modes and longer fire range. Seeing modern-shooter-like weapons in Far Cry 3 performing like stuff from early 2000ths is very lame.  And on top of that, there's dumb AI that pretends you are cloaked while the enemies are unaware of you presence, making stealth fun at first and boring once you learn the AI exploits and take deadly machette walks right in middle of their camp (with simple precautions).  And the game doesn't use much of my CPU nor GPU power either and still has performance issues regardless of graphic settings. So, I play on ultra (no antialiasing though) with drops to 35 FPS and lower the settings to minumum just to make 2 FPS difference. This phenomen is also known as Ubisoft optimisaton.  P.S.: Many users of high-end computers (Intel, Nvidia, AMD, ATi, whatever) have performance issues in the cut scenes. I have this too.",-1,0

1316676,220260,Farming Simulator 2013,"I'm giving this game a contingent 'yes'. If you played FS2013, this is disappointing, if this is you're first time, then you'll like it. It's a good game overall but adds almost nothing in the 2 years since FS2013. Sure logging has been added but this is a game about farming, and very little has been done in the actual farming department.   First off, let me say this is definitely FARMING simulator and not USING FARMING VEHICLES simulator. What I mean by that is the concept of farming, what to do and how to do it in terms of growing crops is solid. What's not solid is the actual gameplay of the vehicles. The physics is pretty bad. The vehicles have no weight to them, accelerate and decelerate instantly, and have horrible turning physics (I'm NOT referring to the turning when you are attached to a tool but do not have a counter-weight up front, that is good attention to detail, but turning in general is awful). The cockpits are alright, but nothing lights up, very few instrument gauges work, and nothing is clickable. A few new vehicles have been added, mostly those associated with the new tree logging though.  Furthermore, nothing has been improved when it comes to growing crop. You still have the same options and equipment. You'd think the devs with all this time would add something new like beans or even vinevards or fruit trees, but no, same as FS2013. Same can be said for farm animals. Nothing changed. You also get the same side, repetitive side missions. This is a REAL big disappointment, 2 years and the devs can't even think of a new side mission?   The world still feels so empty and unlived in. There is no sense of 'people' living around you. If you go into the one town you might see a one or two people walking but that's about it. There is some traffic but its not convincing at all. There is no AI really and they drive at like 5 mph for some reason. I wish the game gave you a reason to use your lights and turn signals when on the road, but with such unbelieveable traffic there's no option in even pretending to role play.   At this point you might be wondering why I'm recommending this game after saying only negative stuff about it. Well, if you haven't played FS2013, then you won't be so disappointed. The game itself is very fun and makes you think about how to manage your crop and sell it at the biggest profit. The little side missions are fun (considering you haven't played FS2013) for the first few hours and are a nice change for pace from normal farming. The graphics are generally nice and reasonably well-detailed. A nice touch added is that your tractor and farming equipment now get dirty with use and can be cleaned off with a pressure washer (although equipment gets dirty way too quickly). Overall it's a solid game, especially if this is your first time. If you ever see this on sale for $20 or less, I'd say definitely pick it up if you're interested. At full MSRP however, you should checkout some gameplay and really think about if this is the kind of game you'd enjoy. If you're someone who plays a lot of sim games, then the answer will probably be yes. If not, maybe wait for a sale to get the most fun/$ out of it",1,0

Also well colour coded enemies in this kind of game is a stupid idea, fighting a heavy enemy that only takes damage from the light damage weapon meant for crowd control just leads to you clearing out the rest of the encounter and then wailing on it for a minute while it never touches you and it just kills the pace of combat.",-1,0

Nothing more fun that exploding demons everywhere. -Tons of combos and ways to play using different weapons and upgrades for them. -Boss fights were not that annoying, so if you do not like Boss fights I would not worry about them here. -The zones in this game are freaking outlandishly awsome. I do not want to spoil but they took a ton of creativity making them. - Great Graphics for the most part (will mention below) - Works great with an XBox controller  Cons: - Shadows look a tad funky, which might be because the game prefers AMD Radeon. - sometimes the camera is annoying, but not that annoying. - game is totally linear (it does not bother me, but some people do not like that stuff) - Controls for a keyboard will be a nightmare. - was a tad short I beat it in like 14 hours with no extras done.

Having said that, the ship crafting is somewhat unique as far as I've seen and I really wish the game would have gotten somewhere, alas it won't be so and paying full price from unfinished early-acess game isn't worth it.  If you see the game for 5€ or so, it definetly gets my recomendation. Otherwise, I can't really say you should ever get it.",-1,0

1321783,220660,StarDrive,"This game is a lesson in bad management and bad design practice.  You simply do not promise features in a game if you cannot deliver them. You can publish a list of features that you desire to add if possible, but you only promise the core elements. And then once in production, you do not just abandon the project to start a new game, especially a sequel. It is an unwritten contract between the dev and the buyer that you will deliver a working game with as few bug as possible.  As this game exists, the dev simply wasted to many development hours on a single feature. The ship designing options in this game are hands down one of the best that I have seen. You have so much control within the constraints put in place. However, the whole purpose of a ship design is to utilize it in its function, typically combat. And while combat is decent and some what fun, you need an economy to support it, and Stardrive simply does not have a well working economic model.   In fact, the game ends up punishing you for the 1st 30 min to hour of play. 1st by making you feel like you need to grind a bunch of base technologies just to be capable of performing the basic functions of a 4x game. You will need new planets to expand you economic abilities, but you will feel you need 4 technologies before you can successfully colonize a planet: a food tech, a production tech, an income tech, and the ability to expand on to prohibited terrain. However, if you focus on these techs to quickly start expanding, the AI comes and smacks you around because your military is weak. So lets say you focus on military techs (like guided missiles and armor; yah, no armor before this tech), your units are capable of carrying a basic fight, but the AI has now colonized any half-decent planet on the map. But then you say to yourself, I've got a big military I will just invade a weaker AI. Welp, hope your like rebels suddenly poping up on your worlds with no prior indication of unrest because your income rate cannot support even a half decent fleet unless you colonize new worlds. But wait you say, I'll just build a smaller but higher tech fleet; nope. Not enough fire power to successfully invade a AI held world because unsuprisingly the AI has a fleet just as big if just a bit smaller but like 3x the troops you were able to build. And all of this early game will determine whether you will win or loose late game.  However, this is not to say you cannot do well. If you get lucky, the random map has placed habitable planets as neighboring systems, given you one of the less aggressive races as a neighbor, and not block those systems with hostile drones. If you can survive this early game, the game can be a good bit of fun. At least up until some late game bug or unfixed feature ends your fun.  A game should not punish players for trying to perform the tasks the game demands or make them slog through a list of Techs that can make or brake their game just to successfully perform those tasks.",-1,0
1325248,220780,Thomas Was Alone,"I have to say, this game is surprisingly beautiful. It just has all the right pieces you need.   The atmosphere, the narrator, the storytelling and the mutual struggles the little shapes are going through makes you connect with them. Everything fits in nicely and the game really manages to touch you. Great piece of art.   Game-wise, it's a solid platformer with great style and flavour. In most platforming games you play to reach a high score or to reach the end of the level. Here, you play to go on with the story, which is superbly meshed in with the gameplay.

1336648,221040,Resident Evil 6,"I forgot how boring and stupid this game is. Resident Evil 6 is a survival horror game where you aren't really surviving and there is no horror. 'Survival' mainly consists of simply running up and kicking zombies in the face to death. Unlike the good RE games you don't even have to be wary of the zombies anymore. They are no longer a threat that you have to work your way either around or through strategically. They are just something in your way from point A to point B that you simply shoot or kick your way through. What's the point?  Through the entire start of Leon's campaign I didn't even have to use my gun once. The melee attacks basically give you the 'Press left mouse button to win' option. After that, everything was easy. And boring. By the time I was done, I actually forgot why I was playing in the first place. I wasn't having fun or being challenged. The game just led me from one area to the next asking me to occasionally press a button or two along the way.  Resident Evil 4 is my favorite game of all time, and everything it did right, this did so - so wrong! I wasn't crazy about Resident Evil 5, but it was at the very least enjoyable at times. Resident Evil 6 is just garbage.",-1,0
1337043,221040,Resident Evil 6,"First off I would like to say that I very much enjoyed this game on my PS4. I bought this as part of a 'every resident evil' bundle, because why not right?  This is probably one of the worst ports of a game I have ever seen in my life. The controls are absolutely abysmal in every imaginable way. They somehow managed to take something that needed MAYBE four buttons, excluding the directional keys, and make it an exercise in keyboard gymnastics.  So many keys that could have just been combined into a single damn key that were, for reasons only the most demented, drug addled soul could decypher, were split onto two or three keys in the case of 'Pick up / open door / action'. You know, they key that the FPS genre figured out 20 years ago could just be bound to E.  If you get this game free as part of a cheap bundle, then fine, but don't waste your money buying this game on it's own. Do yourself a favor and just go by the console version.",-1,0
1337547,221040,Resident Evil 6,"This is going to be hard, since I've never written a review that didn't recommend a game. But Resident Evil 6 ist not a good game. The only reason I played it for around 30 hours is the coop part. Yes any game gets bearable if you play it with a friend (see Kain and Lynch). But even the coop fails during the last campaign. It's clearly set to be a singleplayer campaign, so the second player always magically teleports to the main character and cannot pull any levers of hit switches. That is so extremely annoying, that I really wanted to quit.  The idea of of telling a story from 4 different views (4 campaigns) would have been cool, if the story itself wasn't so darn boring. The gameplay. Well how do I put this. Have you ever bought a brand new High End PC for a game event that was coming up with your friends and that everyone just ended up sharing movies? The action in RE would be great, you can dodge, take cover switch between melee and range combat...blablabla. That all doesn't count. Melee is (by far) number 1 of you choices. It makes an incredible amount of damage and makes you (for the time of the attack) invulnerable. Yes aim for the head, when you shoot! Oh wait, that's not helping, because the ennemies regenerate? Well why do we need different kinds of hitzones? The graphics are ok, but from time to time you see EXTREMLY ugly textures, I guess because they thought 'Noone is gonna look at the buildings during a flight mission'. Well I did. And cried.  I'll come to an end I promise : I was looking forward to playing Resident Evil 6, because I LOVED the fifth (that one I finished 8 times with a friend, got every single achievement and still had lots and lots of fun), but it's just not a good game. Not a single part of the game feels like it'd fit. Graphics are more or less ok, the story is horrible, the gameplay unbalanced (and quite frankly BORING), oh and let me not forget this one. CONNECTION ISSUES! This game is out long enough! Why are there still evenings when noone can play because servers are not reachable?! Baaaad CAPCOM! BAAAAAAAAD.",-1,0

1427819,221180,Eufloria HD,"I have been an FPS gamer for most of my gaming life. It is the type of game play that I choose and prefer. I have never been into single player games. What I have to say is, Eufloria HD stomps ♥♥♥. I was hooked from the very start. I was only disappointed when I finished it. Truly a great game!  The graphics are simple, clean and nice to look at. The score for this game was great, as I am in love with electronic music. Adding a multiplayer mode would change the spectrum of this game IMHO. I would certainly love to play online against others. Add a game/map editor with resources and your good to go. BTW, when is there going to be a Eufloria 2?",1,0
1429863,221260,Little Inferno,"To be honest, Little Inferno isn't really a game. 'Gameplay' consists of dragging objects into the fireplace and setting them on fire. There's no way to lose and the only real challenge is figuring out the combo's from the little hint provided. It's more of a 'tech toy' (the fire 'simulation' is actually pretty cool from a programming perspective) with a good helping of humor and social satire thrown in than a game in the traditional sense.  That said, it's also a lot of fun. The music is fantastic and the story/artwork seem simplistic yet still succeed in conveying a feeling of great depth. All in all the quality is excellent, about what I've come to expect from the makers of  World of Goo .  In general, I would recomend it if you can get it at around $5 or less.",1,0
1430375,221260,Little Inferno,"This game is really cute and also just fun to play. You set stuff on fire. Isn't that enough of a reason to play? If it's not, you unlock things to burn and there's a story in the background too which ends up having a message behind it all which is really sweet if you look into it (I feel like the meaning is different to everyone and i'm not going to spoil it). If you don't want to finish the story, you can just use the game as like a fun stress relieving game or something to do when you're bored. You can take photos from your computer and burn them too which is pretty great. 10/10. would burn again.",1,0
1430532,221260,Little Inferno,"This game is quite a unique experience it can be heart warming yet sombre at the same time. It can create an experience like no other game of this type, it creates a type of its own. I'll say no more so play the game to find out!",1,0

The Good  I’ll be very straightforward here: I’m not very good at RTS games. That being said, I still thoroughly enjoy playing RTS games, despite my lack of strategic wisdom. While old, AoE2 is a fun, addictive game. You have a vast array of civilizations to chose from (each featuring their own cultural advantage, unique unit(s), and some have access to technologies that others do not), good graphics, and simple controls. The point here is that you have lots of options. Options are a good thing. A very, very good thing.  Combat is easy enough to understand: certain units are strong against certain units, etc. If you bring a bunch of cavalry to a polearm fight, you’re going to have a bad time. And, yes, that is bitter experience talking. However, even when the chips are down for you, the struggle to survive is still fun. The desperate scrambling to gather resources and pump out units to replace your annihilated army has a certain charm to it.  The Bad  While I understand the graphical limitations of the days in which this game was originally released, with this version being the high def remake, I was saddened to see that most units look largely the same for every civilization. This excludes unique units (hence the unique part) and the buildings do change a bit depending on what your civilization’s culture is like and what part of the world they’re from.  The Meh  See above.  Verdict: Yea  Age of Empires II: HD Edition is a great game and the first game we’ve been able to recommend since our return from hiatus. If I hadn’t have received it as a gift, I wouldn’t have felt bad about buying it. If you’re a fan of the franchise or a fan of RTS, this may be a great investment for you. As always, thanks for reading.",1,0

Each civ has different economic and military bonuses as well as a unit unique to each civ which can make certain strategies more advantagous. e.g Mongol gather food from wild animals faster than other civs which makes their economy stronger early game making an feudal rush a good tactic to cripple the opponents economy before they can bring out units to combat yours.

YAY! I now can recommend this game !",1,0
1461507,22200,Zeno Clash,"Regardless of some of the games shortcomings, this game is highly enjoyable with a very pleasurable 1st-person brawler experience makes for some very solid gameplay that is refreshing to enjoy.    I want to get right into things and talk about the combat first. The combat is fun and is surprisingly fluid. Probably one of my biggest issues with the combat system is the enemies invicible times. Enemies can always override your attacks but there's a lot of times when enemies will commit to a attack and are completely invincible. Making it so you take unncessary damage and it kind of ruins the flow of the game I found. Sometimes you can't even dodge their attack when executing a perfect dodge to counterattack. But overrall the combat is fair game.  In the combat you are either using your bare hands to beat the living snot out of your enemies in a awesome intense fashion, or you're picking their health off with a gun from afar.  The combat keeps it very simple with the controls but also makes for some intense fighting. It's really hard to explain how the combat controls work via text over doing a live commentary for example and talking about how they work in the game itself. But the game has a what I'd say fair learning curve with a stiff challenge you may not be prepared for in skill yet. But ultimately you'll learn how to conquer your foes even if it has you going back a chapter or two to do some training. Which really isn't that big of an issue since the fighting in this game is fun as heck. You'll give your old enemies the one-two-puncharoo and you'll pick up some knew combat techniques (skill specifically, the game locks some advanced combat early game. But all results in combat are based on your skill and use of the controls) and be trained enough to learn how to take out tougher enemies.   I liked the soundtrack, it wasn't perfect. But it was nice and I can remember a few specific tracks that fit my fancy. They fit the fighting scenarios well and they really helped you get into fights, I give them credit for making soundtracks that pumped me up some in a lot of these battles and levels.  The art directive was really strange, I wouldn't say it was memorable or enjoyable persay. But it was interesting to look at and look forward to for their next environments and people. Though I had an issue with the level designs. In the sense of the backgrounds. Everything a little above level eye sight which would be the middle of the screen was sickingly blurry. It was like this in pretty much every level. I had to keep my eyes on the ground and the middle of the screen or I felt sick.  The voice acting was poor in it's own right, but that doesn't really matter. Same with the story, the story was kind of weird and didn't really make any sense besides your were just running away from your home because of your actions. But the story and voice acting and art and some of the blurry vision in the levels really pale in how good the action in this game was.    I know I didn't do a good job at explaining the combat at all, i'd definitely suggest watching a video of it on youtube. But the action brawling in this game is really good fun. It was an experience I was happy to partake in and i'm glad I played this game.    I got this game through trading for it, for it was in a bundle. I heard the game was good and I gave it a try and i'm now here to tell you that is indeed the case. I'd suggest getting it price cut of at least above 5 bucks. Anything below that is just criminal. Though this game is priced at $9.99 or your regional equilivalent and I'd say this game is worth the full price. It's good and I can't say i'd feel bad if I dropped ten bucks on this game. Because even after beating the game there's a challenge mode in-which you beat the crap out of people for numerous amounts of floors and that's jolly good fun too.   So anyways, Zeno Clash. If you don't mind a game that is highly action-oriented and with great combat and that's very fast-paced and alive. Get this game, it's really enjoyable.    Anyways, thank you for reading my review.

1492906,222880,Insurgency,"IMO A COD clone with a touch of americas army.Pick one its kinda like a mash up of all of them without medics and alot of other fun AAA stuff.  PROS.. The sounds are good...(really no joke) Not the worst shooter out there.But another bottom feeder for the masses for a cash grab for a free to play looking and feeling game. Alot of game modes. Good amount of maps. It is just as cheap as CSGO    The garbage.IMO One shot kills...with long respawn timers. Lot of running back to get one shoted again. Kinda clunky movments,you will get stuck to stuff. The part that reminds me of BF4 is the smoke nades that get tossed the whole match..  just looking at where guys are,you wont see them if they are not very close to you,so its kinda got that spray and pray thing going for it. Night maps suck. Spawns can be camped on some maps.(this always sucks) the way you get and attach mods to guns sucks very much. the maps are small/med but ill lean more to small with few paths for true war. Arcade style of play. The gfx are far behind 2015 shooters other then that other ugly one csgo.This one does look better then a nintendo 64 game tho. The scopes in this game not only suck,but are huge,i mean really huge. Ironsights are also so huge its insane.   This is one of those games as you play you just hope something better comes out soon.Spawn,die,spawn,die,spawn die,,nade spam,,,,,,yawn...  I would say i wasted mine,but maybe will play again one day(yeah right). But for you i would say sure its a cheap shooter..cheap gfx,cheaper looking guns just flat out cheap.I think it wanted to be a COD remake or something and failed.  But there is so many free shooters that are REALLY JUST LIKE this on steam..(warface,free to play same thing) another crappy shooter with a fan base that yells the realest war ever!!! not really worth 15-20bucks imo.  The funny  It takes one bullet to kill in this game,why 30 round clips? Smoke nades are like popcorn,more in a match then you thought possible.  The real  One of the games i wish i could get a refund. Flat out garbage.  I don't blame the devs tho..get payed dudes off us scrubs,I would do the same!",-1,0
1495434,222880,Insurgency,My go to game for killing time and having fun.  I always get stressed playing this game (the good kind of stress) because of how intense and realistic it is.   Checkpoint in CO-OP is my favourite closely followed by PUSH in multiplayer. Both mode allow for hours of awesome gameplay.  Highly suggest you get this game!!,1,0
1495801,222880,Insurgency,"This game is amazing! I could spend countless hours playing this game! First of all, there isnt just competitive mode, where you fight other players. There are a veriety of modes which you can choose from, 2 Catagories in which the modes are in.  The first one, which is my favorite, is Cooperation.  In this catagory, there are several modes which require team work, against challenging A.I opponents. This brings me to the A.I of the game. The A.I is acually quite good for the game. It constantly trys to give you a challenge. Of cource it isnt the best, and you can pass the A.I without them even seeing you. Other than that the A.I is pretty good. The diffrent modes in the Cooperation catagory are:  Survival: Survive against waves on enemys Checkpoint: Capture points while pushing back enemy forces. And 3 other fun modes to play from.  I spent all of my time playing this game on the cooperative game modes. They are extremly fun, especially with friends! Also the Workshop support can add alot new maps, weapons and attachments to use/explore.  Overall i highly recommend this game to fans of games like Cs:go. Cod players beware, if you are looking for a game with fast paced action, this might not be the game for you. This requires alot of planning and careful movement if you dont want to die. If you are careless you can die VERY quickly.  Also please note:  There is no health bar for this game! Just 1 bullet can kill you! So be careful!",1,0

1497632,222980,Dead Pixels,"It's a zombie themed knock off of River City Ransom without any of the things that made River City Ransom what it was.  If you can pick it up on the cheap, it's a fun enough way to squander an afternoon, but that's about the extent of it's lifespan as a game.",-1,1
1497670,222980,Dead Pixels,"In my opinion what lies at the heart of the zombie apocalypse genre is the nerve-wrecking paranoid survivalism. How well does this game pull it off? Not exactly great but definitely better than most zombie games I'm aware of. The major flaw of this game is its backward difficulty curve. In the beginning I had only a crappy shotgun, a handful of bullets and a death wish. And that was great because when I inevitably run out of ammo, I had to run from building to building, praying that inside I'll find at least a couple of bullets before the horde of working class gentlemen chasing after me proceed to chew off my face. It was tense, stressful and absolutely awesome, just the way a true zombie game should feel like. Unfortunately, by the time I reached the last streets (a.k.a levels) I had so much money, ammo and medkits, I was practically immortal and all the challenge was lost. In short, the game is rather unbalanced.  Besides the few times when the game crashed and cheered me up immensely, there isn't really anything to complain about from the technical side.  The music is pretty decent but definitely not memorable.  Criticizing the graphics feels a bit awkward considering the fact it's written in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ title what you are supposed to expect. Desperate lack of resources hiding underneath pretentious retro banner. However, despite my rambling, I enjoyed this game a lot. It's in no way deep, is a bit clunky, but it has a sense of style and what it does, it does well. It's definitely worth checking out.",1,1

1503374,223000,7 Wonders: Ancient Alien Makeover,"The main part of this game is basically Candy Crush with a new coat of paint. Match-three with non-square boards and special square-clearing goals. This is not a bad thing. Candy Crush is a good game. It's fun and interesting. Nothing wrong with using those ideas in a new game.  The problem is, Mumbo Jumbo just couldn't let it be fun on its own. Instead of letting the gameplay stand on its own, a good, quality casual game like most of their others are, they completely overdid the extra stuff on this one. There are several minigames (not optional) with totally different gameplay than the game you want to play when you open 7 Wonders. Each of them might be good on their own, but they're not what I want to play right now. They literally interrupt gameplay right in the middle of a level and force you to play a different game.  And then they skinner-boxed it into oblivion. It's not enough to give you a level and challenge you to beat it. You also have to gather resources during play to complete the Wonders you are trying to build. Missed one of the special blocks? Then your level of ACHIEVEMENT will be lower. You have to collect ALL THE THINGS, and try to complete each wonder in the minimum number of levels. If you mess one up, there's no going back and trying again until you've completed the entire wonder.  In addition to collecting materials, you also have to meet other goals to get the maximum star rating for each wonder. No timeouts, get all the special boxes, etc. On top of that, you have to earn special buildings to put in your little village. AND you have to unlock all the achievements. AND you have to earn all the gold coins to buy all the decorations. AND on top of all of this, there are Steam achievements.  It's just ridiculous. The gameplay itself could be fun, but I found myself feeling like I *had* to beat X levels, I *had* to finish building this wonder, I *had* to unlock all the visual upgrades. This is no accident. It's using skinner box techniques, which is dispicable and a sign of poor and lazy design, and it's frustrating because even though I was aware of how they were tricking me into continuing to play, I still couldn't bring myself to delete the game until I had beaten it. When it was finally done, I wasn't proud, happy, excited... I was just relieved that it was finally over. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend that sort of experience to anyone.  In general, I have found Mumjo Jumbo's casual games to be enjoyable and high quality, but this one is a BIG exception. I shouldn't have to feel like I can't stop playing when I'm ready to stop. I shouldn't feel like I have to continue just because of the psychological addictiveness of earning achievements and other shiny, but useless, things. Mumjo Jumbo should be ashamed of themselves for ruining what could have been a great game with this crap, and I hope they don't try this again, or they will lose a loyal customer.",-1,0

Amazing landscape and scenery (especially for 2002) Directions are written, there's no arrow telling you where to go Cons: No Fast Travel, though this could be considered a pro if you're against fast travel, and it allows you to take in the scenery.

1510327,22320,The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind,"Morrowind is one of my favourite games and I would recommend that anyone give it a try. The story is captivating and you actually get a sense of accomplishment after completing it. If you choose to create a custom class, then you may be overwhelmed by all of the different skills, but they allow you to create a character that is truly unique. Speaking of unique, the artifacts and unique items in this game can be very powerful.   But some, such as the Robe of the Lich (Tribunal) are rather useless.   Perhaps the artifacts don't float your goats, well then you could enchant your own items with whatever enchants you want, within reason. That all being said, there are quite a few poor mechanics.  If you have little patience and/or don't like to read you may have a hard time getting into the game, as all the important dialogue is text based and you need to read in order to know what you must do. Your movement speed is also very slow when you first create your character. However, when you level you can choose to increase your speed.   If you get the Boots of Blinding Speed you get a huge speed increase... at a cost.   The combat is extremely tedious when your character is a low level, and if you're really unlucky a mudcrab could kill you. But because enemies don't scale you will feel like a badass when you can one hit a mudcrab.   TL/DR    Pros",1,0

This fact is important in highlighting the biggest problem with this software: the group that made it just doesn't care about their audience.  As quickly as possible, they try to force-feed you everything about the character you're playing and the situation your in. There's so much information that nothing stands out, so it isn't clear what the atmosphere is. Suddenly, you are driving a vehicle capable of movement in any direction and the controls aren't explained. Your character is inside a maze where nothing about the environment pops out to clue you in as to where you should go, and half the time the waypoint system lies to you (what did I expect, though, right?).  On top of all that, you are under attack, and to make a very difficult situation even worse, if your vehicle takes damage you might have a breach, which leaks out your oxygen unless you find a repair powerup (read: rare health kit), turning your screen dark as it slowly kills you.  The game is mercilessly convoluted and brutally unforgiving to it's player. At one point while trying to find the 'exit', I found an opening and headed that direction to escape, only to realize as I was blasted to bits that the ship I saw outside was THE ENEMY, and after reloading realizing that I was supposed to come out of the doorway, then turn AWAY from the opening to see the doorway which was the intended direction.

I was one of them. But now I just think the game didn't age well and doesn't deserve all that hype. The two first hours were fun but that's all. The sandbox genre is more suited for games that feature free roaming and free killing. RWS is a company that can bring up some good ideas but overall they don't have the talent to make a game with good execution.

1586716,22380,Fallout: New Vegas,"Well, crap. I don't know how I could have spent more than a hundred hours in Fallout New Vegas (F-NV). Really. By all accounts, the game isn't that good... and yet... A hundred hours! Come on! There must be something, right?  To make it short, I believe that F-NV dances around the “no more” line that we all have regarding video games. Y'know, the hypothetical line in the sand, the point of no return, etc. All gamers have a tolerance for some form of nonsense from a game, be it bugs, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ quests and whatnot. In the case of F-NV, I would guess that most players don't have the patience to put up with the failures of the game, regarding the gameplay, the plot, but must importantly the bugs.  Even now, years after release, the game is unstable and crashes, less regularly than at first, but still. You can't just ignore it. Couple that with the now old “oblivion” engine graphics and NPC's, and you really don't see a lot of positive aspects in it. Be warned then, patience is required, on a simple engine level, before even acknowledging the game in and of itself. You will need to use the console command to debug some of the quest, the main quest even! What I'm saying is that some part of the game are so bugged that even now, without a cheat, the game is impossible to complete if you go down some dialogue paths and whatnot. Brilliant! The main plot revolves around two factions trying to control a strip of land. Honestly, in hindsight, I would guess that this was kind of a beta game for the gameplay of Skyrim, with two factions fighting for a strip of land (and the scripts required to make the player feel invested). This is a personal interpretation, but the feeling of playing a beta, a test for something else never really left me.  I would also like to point out that, like Fallout 3, I do not believe that the gameplay of the “elder scroll” works in a universe with guns. It just doesn't. The animation of the characters is too weird to allow for a reliable way of aiming. Plus, in hardcore mode, I can't even fathom how you could play anything else than a sneaky/thief like character. So much for roleplaying. But those are general issues, there were present in Fallout 3 too. If you could look past them then, you can do it in F-NV too.   The “real” almost game breaking aspect I have with F-NV has to do with ♥♥♥♥. Yep, ♥♥♥♥. To me, it is mentioned way too often, implied or even outright acknowledged. Really, it is almost central in a lot of quests. The depiction of how women are treated here is really... well, disheartening. I don't mean to imply that I believe mankind to be better than this, -especially in a post-apocalyptic world-, it's just that it brings me down, in a “dude, you're ruining my mellow” kind of way. If I wanted this kind of feeling, I would play Spec Ops the line, the post-traumatic stress simulator, not an escapism RPG. And I'm a man! I can't even begin to see how women might come to view this. Perhaps worse? Perhaps less? Perhaps F-NV just opened my eyes, I don't know. What I do know is that some quest are really ugly, psychologically speaking. The fact that there is humour in the game is actually quite jarring for me. Talk to one guy about how he had to kill his wife, and his unborn child, about to be sold into slavery just be confront in the next minute with a lunatic, paranoid, not meant to be taken seriously in the least, NPC is really, really weird. The tone of the game is all over the place, and there are more examples. This is especially frustrating to me, who likes to play morally “grey” characters, but who, by comparison here, are good not matter what they do. The hero mantel is kind of forced upon you, I guess.  So, what remains if you look past the bugs, the gameplay and the tone? Well... Uh. A basic/generic Bethesda RPG. That might be enough for some. What really redeems the game for me are the DLC's. Because of how they deal with the main plot and the background of the main protagonist, it seems clear to me that F-NV was a rushed game. That and the bugs. Clearly, the DLC's seemed to have been part of the main plot at some point, but hey. Are they any good at least?  Well... They try. I know this is weird, but I can't give a recommendation to them. They try and kind of fail, which is better than to not even try. But, okay, let me explain: The first DLC, dead money, introduces new enemies which, -dead space like-, can only be killed by dismemberment. Awesome! Except that the DLC takes your weapon and so forth. Basically, it is very challenging, but only because the game ties your hands behind your back. It never feels “fair”. Still, nice try. On a side note, it also kind of ruins, for me, the character of Father Elijah, which had, up until then, at least the benefit of the doubt of not being a total asshat. After that DLC, there's no more doubt. The second DLC, honest hearts, is forgettable: why are there American Indians in the Fallout lore al of a sudden? Urgh, whatever, kill them (again) and move on.   The third DLC, the big empty, or old world blues, is worth a special mention. It has by all accounts no right to be so interesting, so well written, so weird and challenging story-wise in this game. At first, I would have recommended F-NV just for this DLC, but it drags on a little bit too long, has balance issues (the mechanical scorpions are way over the top!). Worst of all, the DLC is apparently meant to be taken seriously! It's supposed to be in the continuity of the lore of Fallout, which is really stretching it, even by my non-fan accounts. Oh, it's fun and funny, but come one! The closest I can explain this is, is with the Mass Effect 3 Citadel DLC, expect here the citadel DLC is constantly referenced afterwards. It's just weird, it doesn't help with the tone at all. Can't we just have fun? Must everything be in continuity and taken seriously? Can't we just have a laugh? Still, the enemies are nice and kind of “original” (Wild Wild West with mechanical scorpions anyone?) and the voice acting is nice (never had I “breathed” a woman to climax before. Still don't know what to make of that).   The last DLC, lonesome road, is the worst of all in my opinion. The main antagonist is an idiot, and that ruins it all. I'm really sorry, but there is no redeemable quality to him. I get what there were trying to do, but it just fails. Still, the boss fight was probably the most challenging, expect for the fact that the whole DLC is riddled with automatically administered stimpacks, so you can just stand in the open and fire with complete disregard for your own safety without any adverse effect. Did I mentioned that Bethesda's Fallout have balance issues?  In the end, I hated my time in F-NV as much as I enjoyed it. I'm completely ambivalent to it. I suppose, I couldn't recommend it in clear conscience. There would be so many warning labels on such a recommendation!   It's... okay.... I guess?",-1,0

1602588,224260,No More Room in Hell,"A pretty awesome and addicting Zombie Survival game, but with some downfalls. All-in-all it's a really great multiplayer experience; practically everyone chats and interacts while playing and help out to some extent. On the downside, though, there is little to no help from the actual game regarding objectives and moving through the maps. Your objective appears once on the screen for a short while, and that's it. There's no indicator of where that objective is, and you also have no way of knowing where your allies are unless they tell you, and this is especially bad because it's really easy to get left behind and lose your way. The typical excuse here is 'cuz realism', but let's face it, realism is NEVER really a good thing in games. Some things contributing to realism, such as having to hold your reload key to check ammo and health, are acceptable and actually add a lot to the aspect of survival, but simply leaving players in the dark with little to no assistance is taking it too far. I'd like to know where I can find others at the very least, and I'd like at least SOME help from the game. Fortunately, you can find quite a few seasoned veterans online that know what they're doing; just be sure to stay close and keep your eyes open. 6.5 out of 10 simply because of the severe lack of an in-game interface.",1,0

Had to get used to the controls but after the ending I got used to the controls and was able to put that to the test with playing the workshop levels. What I mean by this is that the game is too short. I only spent 4 hours going as slow as I possibly could around the levels and it was still too short. Besides the workshop that has a lack of levels at this moment in time and will have me very busy when more levels come out, there needs to be more stuff coming from the developers for the story or maybe something new entirely other than the story. I still think it was worth the $12 but being that the game is so short, I am starting to think otherwise.",1,0

Back in 2013, the game was thriving, I was enjoying the game and every level. Now when I go in for a quick match to see how it evolved over the course of a year of me being absent; it is horrid. There is only about 5 active servers (all with varying game modes), and connecting to any of them introduces major lag. There is litterally no enjoyment out of the game now. Ever since the evolution to Battle Builder, the game has gone down hill.

1626983,224760,FEZ,"Fun experience, the gameplay mechanic made for interesting and fun platforming. The game is very visual. The gameplay (platforming) is never too challenging, so it really relys on the design of the level. Each world is unique and inspired, bring a fresh visual appeal and possibly some nostalgia.   But what really sets the game apart is the challenge that comes from the puzzles. Additional puzzles get extremely difficult to the point of impossiblity. To this day I think it is unknown if a puzzle can even be properly solved (which is a good and a bad thing). I admit I looked up how to do the most challenging puzzles, but even the ones just a level below that were challenging and engaging. I only wish that all the puzzles in the game were solvable because it is believed that one or two did not have in game solutions which is disappointing because with the thought that went into the puzzles, the final ones could have been a lot of fun to try to solve. Overall, I recommend the game and suggest that you attempt the most difficult puzzles without looking anything up if you're up for a challenge.",1,0

Ultra cute and reminisent of my era of gaming, the same can be said for the sound on opening a chest, hearing the Zelda like sound never fails to make me smile. The concept of the game sounds good but the reality it fails on so many levels. Simply put I find this game a chore to play  The main down point of this game for me is the 'Galatic Map' It's one, if not 'the' most unsensical piece of UI I have ever come across.

HOWEVER, what this game lacks is the ability to play co-op, and more of an 'open galaxy' to explore... I wish it had more options to scavenge and travel. However this isn't what the game is 'about' so it is understandable, but disappointing. This game could've been so much better.  Also the story line is... there aren't any words for it really... the webcam conversations you have with the President and so forth are extremely cheesy and don't fit the atmosphere of the game at all.

Still, once you get it working, it's not a bad tomb raider game. The story breaks the continuity in an interesting way, making it sort of several shorter prequels in one. This is quite interesting. It does mean the game jumps around a bit, but the stories in themselves are quite good.  The levels, as usual, are very nice, and due to the nature of the many stories, this game return sto 'classic' tomb raider fashion of having lots of different environments. They all look good, but I notice they feel a little smaller than usual. Personally, I think this works well for the game.  A good anthology of tomb raider shorts.",1,0

Gladly, I bought the game on winters sale, otherwise i would be a little bit mad about the purchase. I really like story-based games, i liked The Walking Dead, Beyond two Souls, Dragon Age, Mass Effect and some of the Final Fantasy series, so I thought this would be the next great (little) game for me. It wasnt... it was at maximum ok and I really cant figure out the storyhype here   Graphics 7/10  It has its moments. These moments where you think: Wow, that is beautiful beyond any other game ive seen so far. But in my opinion this comes more with the design of the levels rather than the graphic itself - if that makes sense to anyone. The Unreal Engine sometimes shows it muscles (especially in the later part of the game) but lets face it: Some things simply look crappy   Sound 4/10  Again two sided... The music and athmosphere produced by its soundtrack are great, but someone in the design team decided to give the characters a fictional voice (like in the sims) which really REALLY destroys immersion and bonding with the characters   Control 8/10  Some dont like the controller-based controls in this game. Because its not 'PC enaugh'. I call that bulls***. I have a PC to play whatever I like to, and how I like it. And in this game its a new, refreshing type of conrtol to play with. I love how you have to play both Brothers at the same time! (thats why you need a controller, both analog sticks) Sadly thats it. You got the two analog sticks for the brothers and one interaction button for each. Nothing else...   Content 2/10  Its very short. And although the levels are designed amazingly wonderful its strictly linear and there is not much to explore in the world. You can 'interact' with people and things, but nothing special. e.g. you can sniff a flower or elsewhat   Story 6/10  I cant understand the good reviews about the story. Its ok, not more. The last part of the game is great but until then there is nearly nothing.   Difficulty 1/10  Way to easy! If there werent some here not mentioned 'scenes' it would be a great game for children.

Aside from the striking visuals, it's hard to recommend this game. It's too easy and obvious for adults and way too hopeless and violent for kids. The action/puzzle/platformer set pieces are straightforward and contrived, the narrative is razor thin, and the payoff at then end is limited. The controls are somewhat clumsy (but functional) on a controller, but virtually unplayable on a keyboard.  I'll give it a 6/10. Play it if you're curious but by no means treat this game as a must-own.    ",-1,0

Don't get me wrong, I love the idea behind this and the game as some really cool mechanics, wicked humor, and is the right mix of RPG and FPS. However, the camera in this game is annoying as hell. Basic functions of walking or driving a vehicle will have you believing that you are drunk. For random reasons, I have yet to figure out, the camera changes angles indiscrimately and at critical times while trying to do something. I mean what is the purpose (ever!) to move a camera angle to anything but behind a vehicle when you are driving it? I don't want to see what I look like in the car, I want to see where I'm going. Targeting enemies or getting around obstacles is more difficult than it needs to be. After decades of FPS games on the market, how is it that a developer can screw this basic thing up so badly. It's sad that one simple thing ruins this game so easily and that it can be easily fixed. Not going to be playing much of this one unless the camera is patched.",-1,0

I  love  Cities in Motion 1 and was excitedly looking forward to the sequel but it fails in every respect. Instead of taking the existing, functioning, and very fun CiM1 and improving upon it, it feels like the developers started from complete scratch. Spreadsheets and boring route planning are the name of the game ('game') in CiM2.

This game, once you get a hang of it is actually extremely fun to play and rewarding. Almost all heroes are wonderfully done and playing with any of them feels quite unique and like you're that character. Crafting needs some serious improvements, like some other stuff, but developers are working on it as we speak. Leveling is easy, story mode is beautiful and very interesting. The story itself is genious.  PvP is bad, but that will change too, in the upcoming months. Once you hit level 60, that is when the fun really begins. You will farm (not the fun part) for your hero uniques, various artifacts, medallions, insignias, etc, but you will also do many group contents like raids, patrols, even farming in a group. Most players are very polite and willing to help you when you ask them nicely. Achievements are in general rewarding and fun, while some of them are a pain in the... As for pricing and in game purchases, you are not forced to buy anything, but if you really like the game, support the developers and buy a costume or something from the store, they will greatly appreciate it.  Now, one final word. Developers are friendly, they are willing to work things out with you and solve many problems, but also listen to you feedback and change stuff in players don't like how's something done.

This game was obviously launched before of it being ready and playable. Lots of bugs, extremely broken hitbox system, it's almost impossible to kill 2 zombies at a short interval. I know it's supposed to be a simulation game but why can't a zombie die after you hit his rotten, soft head with a baseball bat like million times?

1676992,226840,Age of Wonders III,"Definitely a fun hex-based, turn-based, fantasty,type...thing.  A very fun experience overall, although there are some changes which I am not too fond of. Still prefer this series over the Heroes and Might and Magic series.   A. Combat. the combat is great in that you still have the massive amount of soldiers all fighting each other with individual abilities and stats. The cons (for me) are that: range attacks seem to have been simplified, at long ranges your shots plain out do less damage, when there is obstructions the damage goes down. I have yet to experience a missed attack or an attack hitting a unit or object obstructing the projectile path. Another thing is that the game has switched from the old squad of single units (like a party of heroes almost) to every unit being a small group of units in civ, this appears to be mostly visual and does affect the damage too much when most of that unit/group dies but I don't like it (although that's just my problem and probably doesn't bother anyone else). Debuffs are almost a necessity because there are some units you will come across that are just plain out overpowered (one unit in the game can pretty much kill off an entire party of units in one hit). All hero units have individual skillsets now, items are nice (flying mounts and rare mounts look amazing).   B. Civ management. Civs are pretty simple as always, build cities, simple buildings and tile management is non-existent, just get it into your border and it's yours. The Magic research tree is now the overall tech tree, this means you make the choice between researching tech upgrades and researching new spells, odd but it works since the older games only really had you research a few key spells and then not care about the rest.   C. Visuals/Audio. Everything looks great, background tracks are amazing.   D. Story, it's alright from what I've seen but it's not the most captivating experience. It makes everything a bit more interesting but the campaigns are more of a do this objective because reasons, rather than getting you motivated by the story.",1,0

1678586,226860,Galactic Civilizations III,"I love Galactic Civilizations I and II and have spent hundreds of hours on each game. I very much looked forward to Gal Civ III. Unfortunately, the product I bought is not finished. Beta masquerading as a retail product. Little thought has been given to ground combat, which is a joke. The attacker will always steamroll over the defender even when outnumbered. Building planetary defenses made zero difference. Master of Orion (I'm talking about the very first MOO) had way more depth for ground combat.   Approval from the people is meaningless. I can have planets at zero approval and just suffer a slight drop in growth/productivity. Seriously?? At zero approval, the people should be rioting and putting my governor's head on a ptichfork. If I had any governors. Nope, no such feature yet.  I have no doubt that Gal Civ III will be a great game. Eventually. After all the patches and DLCs. Until then, I am shelving this game.",-1,0
1678988,226860,Galactic Civilizations III,I have been a fan of the Galactic Civilization series for a while. I recently came back to it with GC III. The game is fun but the learning curve seems to be a bit steeper than I remember. It seems like the only strategies that work now are the “Rush” strategies. I used to go science heavy. I’m sure that I’m just relearning it though. There is a lot of replay ability to this game and I still find myself having trouble not clicking “next turn”. I’m looking forward to future game balance patches but ultimately I think the game is a lot of fun.,1,0

1683656,226980,Pinball FX2,"In general, PFX2 physics, table layouts, and rulesets contribute to an imbalanced, boring slog of a pinball game. Constant dead shots that score little and contribute to nothing worthwhile. Too-short hurry up timers across the majority of tables. Visual clutter and irritating voice samples are the norm.  The fact that it's fictional pinball is rarely leveraged in a good or meaningful way. Many tables are adorned with cheesy 3D models that contribute nothing--often sucking up time with bad animations, or actively obscuring the playfield.  It was the only game in town for a couple years, but Pinball Arcade puts it to shame now.",-1,0

1686776,227080,Papo & Yo,"I was gripped the moment the game loaded. From the artistic main menu, to the absolutely gorgeous look to the game, to the fluid game play and stellar control feel, this game is top notch. In fact it makes some of the other titles that I've been playing lately all of a sudden feel mundane.  I've noticed a few reviewers have felt the game to be boring, but this wasn't the case for me at all. It was SUCH a refreshing change from the usual 'gun and ammo seeking' games that have flooded the market. Trying to kill everything that moves before it kills you is not part of this game at all...you're actually trying to help someone who needs help. I suspect that those who didn't like this game fall into the COD or war gamer category, and that's not me.  If you're remotely curious about this game then dive in and get it! You won't be disappointed.   9/10",1,0

I really wish games like this would have existed when I was a child as it would have helped me cope, fortunately I had a supportive and understanding family.

1688775,227100,Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army,"My computer has a R9 card running on a 4K monitor and runs well.   Compared to the original Sniper Elite this game features a better kill cam and graphics. I love the graphics.  BUT this game lacks the story and tempo or the original game. You are very rushed -- which isn't good for sniping. If you like to spray and pray then wave after wave of zombies is cool. But the problem is that there isn't enough ammo for your secondary weapon in the whole world. The zombies move so erratically that their heads are too hard to hit. A head shot is needed to stop a zombie from regenerating.   I have tried again and again and again to beat this game. It is so frusterating. I can't. But I had no problem with the original Sniper Elite. I am at the part where you are trying to get to the church and there are about 50 zombies and one of those big killer machine gun guys. I shoot him time and time again and he never goes down.   Well, I quit.

So, I decided to save up my cumulative load times since last year. I'm happy I did, because I would've had to change my review to reflect all the awesome changes the developers have enabled for this software since then. I'm so entirely happy I installed this, especially being an extreme advocate of triple monitors. I've put this software through trails in processing and it has held up every time. It has only ever crashed due to a conflict with a screensaver that I uninstalled out of disinterest anyways.   Thusfar I believe this is the highest score I have given to anything, but it is well earned. This software was polished on windows 8.1, but then I'm using it on windows 10, and the developers diddn't suddenly invent a new product like other software I know *Cough* Start8 *Cough*, they stuck with the change and that says a lot about a developer! I'm more than happy to announce my rating of 96/100.  TL;DR: This is an awesome peice of software and if you have 2 or more monitors, you should definately have this installed.

You can still have some fun, but Red 5 is not trustworthy.  More changes nobody asked for, except this time they even added some Pay2Win items (speed boost, damage boost and jet boost for an hour). They also almost added a chopper that looks almost identical to a chopper that was supposed to be exclusive to people who bought the commander pack back in beta (nearly if not the same model, added some orange stripes and a spider to the paint job). The problem with that isn't that there is another chopper, it's that Red 5 was dishonest. The P2W items aren't really worth the money they cost, but Red 5 was dishonest there as well. They promised they would never, ever allow people to buy power. I don't mean someone once said that on a forum, they actually sent founders a letter saying that they would only sell cosmetics and convenience. The morals of this company have changed, not just the game. Maybe Red 5 does change after all.  -----------------Older stuff below----------------------  As of version 1.3.1869, it's still worth a try and fun can be had from playing with other people. The movement system is good, the classes are fun, the open world combined with the movement and mobility is great. The instanced content is fun. The game can feel very repetitive after you do everything though.  Just don't buy anything. This game had so much potential and Red 5 blew it over and over and over. Some people say they listened to the community too much because a community is never 100% in agreement about everything and the game never had a direction that stuck. Some say they listened too little because they changed things most people were fine with and did lots of reworks very few people (if anybody) asked for. Many of the developers are very talented. The people managing the game are incompetent. Lots of layoffs, delayed paychecks (around Christmas 2015) and 40% pay cuts for current employees (January 2016) indicate the game isn't going to last much longer, at least in the west. Any money you spend will probably go down the gutter in about a year.

They need a lower graphical setting that's playable for some not-so-modern computers, then I'd be able to recommend, as I could play for once.  -10/10, Would not recommend.",-1,0

1756180,228260,Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes,"Highly recommended for fans of the turn-based strategy genre or games like Civilization. Personally I found it to be more fun than Civ due to the fantasy setting including the use of spells, the presence of a campaign, as well as a wide variety of other features.  +Both regular sandbox and campaign modes +Good selection of factions and units +Recruit and level faction leaders and heroes +Tactical turn-based combat, many skills and items +Shop and upgrade weapons and armor for heroes and units +Quests present even in sandbox mode keep things interesting  -Some sluggishness in larger games with more factions -Requires making another 3rd party account -Some quests don't seem to trigger properly all the time",1,1

1757087,228260,Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes,"This game had some good elements, but I would say that most aspects of it fall short. Its like civilization and your units group in an army and you go to a battle screen kind of like Total War games. Except the battles are turn based and I have a lot of problems with the battles, The ranged units can hit anywhere on the map... So your weaker mages or archers get picked off easy, especially if you auto-resolve, all your weak units will be dead, all other units no damage. Also the fights start pretty much face to face, first person to move usually gets the kill. One thing that really annoyed me was the character models, they are going for a RPG element with lots of items for heros, except the heros and items look sooo horribly bad, Like I dont understand how these days, even a modest graphic designer could probably nock out some really good character and item models. The game might be worth getting for under 5 bucks, other than that pass it up. If you really want a city building fantasy battle game go for Warlock - Master of the Archane, seems like a nice one so far,",-1,0
1757210,228260,Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes,"It is a good game in the style of Master of magic / Civilization but I have a machine that is way beyond the requirements and the game keeps crasing to no end.

Still, buy with caution. It is an ok game if you like CIV / Master of magic and such.",-1,0
1757243,228280,Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition,"It is very disappointing but I have to give this game a thumbs down for now. Not because it's a bad game within itself, but because at it's current state it is unplayable. The multiplayer aspect of it at least. Singleplayer still has plenty of bugs, but nothing that prohibits you from playing the game.  This is a classic. Baldur's Gate set the standard for western RPGs and introduced a lot of people to the world of Forgotten Realms and Dungeons and Dragons. I didn't have the pleasure of playing the game when it was first released but I saw a couple of friends play it and become sort of obsessed with it. They would praise the game, it's characters, it's story, it's dialogue, get sort of frustrated with its mechanics, not because they were inherently bad but because they were angry at a party wipe or character death which would force them to reload a save. They were frustrated but they wanted to play more. They wanted to finish that hard fight, they want to get the best possible outcome, they wanted to do everything.  Several years later I decided to get this game for myself. Wanted to try it and see what it really was. Truth be told it hasn't aged well but the new patch 2.0 did slightly improved it (more on the patch later). It's still feels old and outdated, you'll find almost no QoL gameplay mechanics, it will feel very slow paced for someone used to a subgenre of RPG games, but the game has qualities which make it a classic.  The story is pretty good (albeit I think BG:II is a lot better but this one is still nice), the characters are rich and interact with the world, you and between themselves, the dialogue is superb, serious when it needs to be, funny when it needs to be and even when it shouldn't. An important part when judging the storyline of the game is not only the story itself but how is represented to the player and how the player chooses to progress through it and BG:EE does that pretty well (again BG:EE II has dramatically improved on said aspect).  The combat might feel slow and sluggish at times, since it is technically a turn based RPG without actually waiting for the NPCs to finish their turn. This pseudo-turnbased combat works well at times and feels awkward at others but I believe it's not something to take away from the fun of the experience.  Sometime ago, beamdog (developing company) announce an expansion for the game called Siege of Dragonspear, 17 years after the original was released (contender for longest time for expansion release along with AoE2). Naturally we were excited to await a continuation of the story and an extra chapter into this game which would also bridge the gap between BG:EE and BG:EE II. Nonetheless in order to accomodate for the release of the patch, they released a patch 2.0 for the game and the sequel. The patch did a lot of thing which I will not mention here but it significantly altered the game. There was an outcry but many people who considered this a pointless and detrimental patch for the 'old-school' players. I didn't really mind the ui changes, the game felt more responsive in our multiplayer sessions however it did the one thing that forced to not recommend this game.  It broke multiplayer. As in it really made multiplayer unplayable. Constant crashes, save files gone (tooks a while but we fixed that), grey-scale pauses, difficulty settings which are always reduced to the previous tier whenever you start your client, you name it. BG:EE has a lot of bugs. I mean a lot. In multiplayer those bugs are  enhanced  since they will translate to frustration for multiple people. However me and my friends were so enamored with the rest of the game that we managed to power through the buggy/unresponsive mess that the multiplayer was and we managed to finish the game just in time for the release of the expansion.  However at this moment we cannot play the game. It is literally unplayable and you're at the mercy of Tymora if you want to get it working. Most of the times it doesn't. Which is a damn shame. Did nobody playtest this in multiplayer? Did nobody else got the game-breaking bugs which many a people report of forums/reviews/discussions about the game.  Most important of all, we were seriously planning to get the Siege of Dragonspear expansion, but we decided not to. Because we want to play the game together as friends but the game won't let us. Until the multiplayer game get fixed, until the bugs are fixed, I  cannot in good conscience recommend  this game and it's expansion to anyone. Seriously, it's a damn shame cause the game itself is a classic. But if you cannot play it, then it's not really a game now is it.  I won't even discuss the 'rage' about trans clerics who have offended some people. This is irrelevant. The multiplayer is unplayable. Fix it and then we can discuss everything else that might be wrong within the game. For shame beamdog, for shame.",-1,1
1757260,228280,Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition,"I do recommend playing Baldur's Gate! Just not really the Enhanced Edition.  Albeit EE doesn't differ from the original much, it does in some significant ways. First of all, it allows running the game in high resolution. You can do it with the old BG too, but that requires a mod, and it's a nice thing to have it without doing anything. EE adds some magical weapons and other items to the game too. Not too many, which is very good, and they are balanced and fit in the game. Moreover, unlike vanilla BG, EE is not limited to Windows only, and can be run on other operating systems. A great thing is also the fact that BG EE has many languages to choose from (albeit no dubbings) so it might be a good way to practice one's language skills. Unfortunately these are the only positive things I can say about EE.   When EE was released it was full of bugs, even gamebreaking ones, but they were fixed by now. Most of them at least, because some things remain broken. For example I couldn't join Alora to my team, because her encounter was broken. Moreover, the quality of the writing when it comes to the new dialogues (and NPCs) is low, and it stands out from the rest of the game, definitely not in a positive way. Hence, it's better to play vanilla game without it. Moreover, for replayability there are many interesting modifications for Baldur's Gate, but they do not work with EE.  Play Baldur's Gate if you haven't already. To decide whether to choose BG:EE or BG you should consider quite a few things.   Why choose BG over BG:EE? - no bugs - quality of the game is the same all-through - modifications  Why choose BG:EE over BG? - multiple language versions (but no dubbings) - multiple operating systems supported (albeit Wine runs BG just fine)",-1,1
1757356,228280,Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition,"The developer, Beamdog, unfortunately is a company who's milking legacy titles. They are not able to make their games so they are trying to sell some extra copies of these old gems like Baldur's Gate by adding expansions.   Yes, maybe couple of hundred people will buy the game because it's 'bumped' by the recent update, but the forced expansion made the entire legacy player community upset. And Beamdoggie is so much disconnected with reality that they're posting self-celebrating announcements describing how epicly they destroyed the game while the forums are flowing with outrage even though they're trying to lock threads around the clock.  We have one of those 'bad developers' here guys, all the symptoms are there. Lack of communication, greed, heavily moderated forums, forced and sudden updates etc. Stay away from this title until the last expansion is made optional.

1762316,228300,Remember Me,"It's not a bad game but absolutely deserves the mixed reviews it got. Nice graphics, world design, concept and music. However, the gameplay is the definition of mediocre, with the main gimmick of memory remixing not being utilized enough, and not quite delivering in execution. It's quite a trial and error affair with some really absurd, illogical solutions. It can be fun to see the different outcomes, though. The 'combo customisation' is arguably false advertising, you're just placing effects in pre-defined slots. The game's worst crime is it's mercifully irregular QTEs because they tell you what to do rather than what key to press (As in it will display a kick symbol rather than the right mouse button). This just makes them less intuitive and more difficult than they should be, meaning you might have to do them a few times.   Game seems to be reasonably well optimised, it runs pretty good for me (i5 4690, GTX 960, 8GB, Win 10).  Pick it up heavily discounted if you're curious. Fanboys of the game are likely just addicted to Nilin's butt.",-1,1
1762335,228300,Remember Me,"I really, really, really, really wanted to like this game. It's pretty. It has nice music. It has some innovative aspects to it. The story seems interesting, at least up to where I've played it (about halfway through).   But the controls - at least with keyboard and mouse - make it infuriating. On top of this, the game's camera always seems to want to look slightly in a wrong direction (up / down). Using the FOV hack helps with this somewhat, but it's still annoying.  Still planning on dragging myself through it, but.. it could be so, so much better, with relatively little effort on the controls and the camera.",-1,0

Bearly physics based projectiles, from what i can tell they arn't. A lot more like Supreme Commander 2, with worse gameplay.  The game is about capping points all around the map, forcing 'Zonecontrol' and not allowing for any real tactics. You either get good at this one type of play, or you lose.

I'd like to think I'm decent at these kinds of games considering how much experience I have playing them but I can't even make it through the regular game mode. I don't think I'm alone in this because almost immediately after this game was released they made an update for it including an 'easy' option and even that one still hands my own butt to me every time. What i want is to meet the developers and watch them play it in front of me so I can see what kind of freakish experts they are. It is entertaining and useful when you have exactly 10 minutes to waste on a game and it's colorful and innovative which are all things that I like. If it just weren't for the unrelenting difficulty then this one get such a better recommendation from me but as it stands the easy mode eventually starts sending out more bad tiles than good tiles and I feel like Lucy in the episode where she and Ethel work in the chocolate factory and I just can't keep up.,-1,0

1781970,230230,Divinity: Original Sin (Classic),"Divinity: Original Sin plays like the heavenly progeny of Diablo 3 gone to bed with Baldur's Gate, so if you even remotely enjoyed either of those I would already highly suggest this title as it seems to contain a lot of promise, a world of possibilities, and is beautifully polished. That said, get used to reading/hearing English English, as opposed to the American English you've gotten used to over the span of most titles - this carries over even to the names of skills and the interface, and feels like a fresh break away from the usual American narrative styles, but don't let that throw you off for a moment, because a moment is all it will take you to warm up to it even if it's not entirely your cup of tea. Make your little party (or tea party), hook up with friends to play through it, and enjoy a less linear isometric title that equals or surpasses the graphics and polish of Diablo 3 or Torchlight visually, and brings the bacon home to those with fond memories of titles like Baldur's Gate, Fallout and Neverwinter Nights 2 who had always hoped for just a little more gameplay depth. GREAT JOB Larian Studios! My hat goes off to you and your wonderful Kickstarter title, and, between this and Wasteland 2, it looks like these Kickstarter traditional rpgs are going to be doing more than a little schooling of the big studios on how to create a memorable rpg, and singlehandedly revive our ol' beloved isometric classic rpg genre. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 xoxoxo (yes, I just absolutely love it!)",1,0

1791536,230410,Warframe,"It was fun while it lasted. I played this game way back when, before all the updates and the console releases. After I while, I quit, mainly because of the lack of people in public games. Anyways, I recently picked it up, and there seems to be a lot more players. I was playing the game pretty heavily until I realized that ulitmately, there is no point to playing the game.  Let me elaborate. What do you do in Warframe? You grind procedurally generated levels in order to obtain new weapons, Warframes, Kubrows, Sentinals, mods, and whatever else you fancy. Obtaining these items and leveling them up gives you mastery ranks, which is the leveling system in the game. What do you do with all this cool swag? Use it to grind the same procedurally generated levels, over and over again.  You might say 'well the levels are procedurally generated, so the game will NEVER get old!' Well.... that's not the case. The levels still get extremely repetitive after several hours of playing, same with the enemy types. There's 3 enemy 'factions' in this game, and each faction has about 5-10 different enemy types. (not exact numbers, but you get the point). Anyways, the enemies get extremely repetitive, ad do the levels.  See, this is my major gripe with the game. Sure, theres tons and tons of items and things you can get that are cool and all, but the core gameplay never changes. It's just grinding, grinding, and more grinding. I realized that playing this game really has no point, and even if I got the best weapon, the best warframe, the best WHATEVER, it'll just be used to grind more of the same enemy types over and over again till the end of time.  In conclusion, I think that this game is fun for a while, but don't get too invested. Maybe it's just me that came to this epiphany, but I hope that I warned you about his game.  Also I spent like $10 on this game, though I got 100hrs. out of it so I think it paid for itself.",-1,1
1792203,230410,Warframe,"TL;DR: I've quit playing Warframe and I strongly recommend you against playing this game as it is not actually fun and is run by developers and administrators who do not value their players.  ...  It's been an interesting last couple months for me in my life, ironically also time that I spent away from Warframe. It started off at the start of May when I simultaneously got sent out of state on a work assignment and also got a 30-day ban from Warframe's forums thanks to its power-tripping, fascist and draconian moderators. While the temporary ban was a slap in the face, since it was over trivial crap such as posting a funny picture in response to a post or saying 'git gud' every now and then (seriously, they don't allow you to say 'git gud'. WTF?), it didn't necessarily bother me as I was too preoccupied with work to even bother with the forums or the game itself.  The funny thing about being given that long away from the game, though, is that it gives you a chance to step back and evaluate your experience with the game overall and to consider how it's gone and what you think of it. But most importantly, it gave me time to think about the most crucial point overall: Is Warframe a fun game to play?  What I've come to realize is that the answer is No; Warframe is not a fun game. At best, it is a mediocre, boring game, where the overall objective seems to be to simply convince yourself that you're having fun so that you can obsessive-compulsively complete the tedious little goal-posts set up in front of you of 'Get this achievement', 'Master this weapon', 'Complete this questline', 'Max this Warframe', 'Get this item drop', and so on. When it comes down to it, Warframe is a sparse, vapid, content-less game that relies upon time-gating and RNG to confuse you and keep you under the impression that what you're doing is fun and interesting as well as hide how dismally short and boring the game's quests actually are. If one were to utilize 'platinum rushing' (spending the game's premium currency to speed things up - a common free-to-play game gimmick) at every step of the way, it's likely that you could complete the entirety of Warframe's story content as well as acquire almost everything in the game in less than a day.  What's worse, the game's developers spend the majority of their time churning out cosmetics and other superfluous nonsense instead of addressing more pressing issues such as fixing game-breaking bugs that stick around for months/years or more at a time, balancing the game's content, and adding real (non-cosmetics) content to the game.  That attitude on their part is unsurprising, too, because it leads back to another realization I've had: The game's developers do not respect my time. After all, to them, I - and all of you - are simply piggy banks. Little human-shaped ATMs that are supposed to simply open their wallets and faithfully hand money over to them and then go away. If my time was respected, there would be more to the game than such insanely aggressive RNG that only exists to time-gate the game so that you remain on the developer-designated hamster wheel long enough for them to churn out more vapid cosmetics for you to buy. In-between working, I came back to check up on Warframe and saw that a new un-vaulting had occurred (an event where 'prime' items that were removed from the loot tables were again made temporarily available, in order to encourage players to continue mindlessly grinding for rare item drops) and now a few shiny little primes were up for grabs. It's also the first time where I just stared at such information, felt absolutely nothing, and thought 'Why even bother?' No, really, why bother? I've done just about everything that can even be done in the game - far more than I should've ever wasted the time even doing - chasing after a notion of fun-having that isn't even there. The prime un-vaulting has come and will go (or has gone? I don't even remember when it ends/ended), I'll have made no effort to take part in it, and don't even care. It's a complete waste of time with no real reward, much like the entire game itself.  So with that in mind, and neglecting to mention the rest of what's wrong with this game for time's sake, I've quit playing Warframe and I highly suggest the rest of you avoid it. I will not be wasting any more time or money on this game, and probably won't even bother with any of Digital Extremes' other games; I can't imagine they're any better than this, if this game is supposed to be representative of their craftsmanship.  Hopefully this review saves you from wasting time on this game. I wish I had known what I know now, so I could've spent all the hours I wasted on it doing something else instead.  P.s. git gud, Digital Extremes. GIT GUD.",-1,1

1801948,230410,Warframe,"now everyone has a conception of warframe, it's not a shooter, it's not a ninja stealth game, but if you look at the games core and how it's build, it's clear. warframe is a dungeon crawler.  they even use dungeon crawler language, such as title set, title, raid, boss, etc. after playing it for as long as i have, you quickly identify where a tile ends and where the next one begins. the maps are great, and the enamies... could be better. *couth* bombards *cough* nullifieries *cough* but besides a few endless black holes that drain fun from my life, this game is great, i love it. i would strongly recommend this game, espeically if you have friends who play it, cause the community is a double faced coin, often times great and helpful, the other... well... warframe people know how the nuclear waste toxicity that comes trade chat. i have a personal theory that these are just the people who got banned from CSGO and needed a new shooter.  but overall this game's community is good. now this isn't for everyone, and people complain about grind. but thats the inherent nature of the dungeon crawler.  some people love it, testing their limits and pushing themselves and their gear to go further, some people don't and leave.  i wouldn't touch warframe if your looking for a trigger shooter, or a stealth game, but if you like dungeon crawlers, i would pick it up. this game is an overall 8.5/10 it's good, and has potential to be better, but isn't thier yet, espeically with new star map, looks like someone threw up a hair ball.",1,0

On one hand the feeling of getting stuck without knowing where to go or not understanding a riddle might be discouraging, but the rewarding feeling of truly outsmarting the game is almost unparalleled.   I could go on and on about the soundtrack, the polish in world design, the amount of content and all that jazz, but if the core part of solving riddles doesn't appeal to you, or you know you lack patience/attention span to really get deep into a game, this might not be a game for you.

The game often has to simply... take breaks, halting all progress in order to stop and explain to you what's going on. If I'd written the review right after completing it, rather than giving it some time to cool off, my review would likely have just been the words 'SHOW, DON'T TELL' over and over again. The fact that a point-and-click adventure game has to rely on heavy narration to convey its plot seems extremely poorly exectued. Secrets in the game are completely pointless - Collecting all the dewdrops reveals a 'secret' that's completely meaningless until it's explained to you at the end of the game - which was five minutes away anyway.  The art is good, and the story CONCEPT is great, but the execution comes off more like a Putt-Putt or Feddie Fish game due to its hamfisted storytelling and constant reliance on the main character trying to be cute/funny. After having to listen to a Dwarf sneeze and cough for five minutes in unskippable dialog, you'll understand what I mean.",-1,0

The entire production feels lazy, from the writing, to the bare-bones sound design. It's almost insulting to think that the game's length (and price) could be justified by its apparent 'randomly generated' enviroment, when in fact its an exercise in back-tracking and uninspired level design with every playthrough.

1848754,231160,The Swapper,"The first thing I want to make clear is that this is not a bad game. It's actually a very thought-provoking, puzzle-intense, short-but-sweet sci-fi adventure with elements reminescent of movies such as Moon, or Alien (sans the jump scares). It's well done for an indie title, and its high metascore is deserved. It's just... not my kind of title, and I don't want to recommend a game based on what it does well, but how -I- enjoyed it.  The core element of this game, its raison d'etre, is the ability to create clones of yourself and to swap into those clones to explore and advance, while attempting to escape an abandoned craft. There are a number of puzzles woven into the narrative that at times stunned me at their cleverness, and the story really makes you think about what constitutes 'you' rather than 'your mind'--but I won't get into spoilers.  Where the game falls short is just -how- frustrating some of these puzzles can be, and frankly, a number can be a bit tedious. Games like Quantum Conundrum can get away with this because of the humorous and light-hearted atmosphere to keep you entertained, but here, the story elements can sometimes feel a bit few and few between. That, and I kind of feel like the game is a little... pretentious? Like it's trying -too hard- to make you think, and it throws you into the story in media res and makes you put the pieces together, as though that makes it deeper than it naturally is.  Other than that, the game doesn't have much else that stands out to me. Visuals are decent, as is the voice acting, but there's scarcely a sound track, and the hidden secrets in this game are -insanely- hard to find without a guide. I found myself both bored and frustrated more than I did intrigued and delighted, and that's a kiss of death for me when it comes to puzzle platformers.  Maybe this is someone else's cup of tea, but it's just not mine.",-1,1
1848755,231160,The Swapper," TLDR:    If you enjoy puzzles you'll probably enjoy this game. The story touches some interesting philosophical points, but the delivery isn't good enough to make it stand out.   I can't recommend this game at its current price (13.99 EUR). There isn't enough content to justify it. Wait for a sale.    Pros:    The puzzles were fun. There was a good mix of easier and more challenging ones.   The atmosphere was great. The visuals and the soundtrack complemented each other very well to make me feel stranded in space.   The story visited some interesting philosophical points.    Cons:    The puzzles were detached from the story. I went from one to the next to unlock the areas, but that was about it. They didn't contribute to the story in any way. Walking around the ship got a bit tedious after a while.   There was very little replayability and I had to complete the game twice to see both endings. My second run felt more like a chore and I would have prefered to be able to finish it once, reload before the ending and see the second ending.   The storytelling should have been better. Finishing the game didn't feel very satisfying and the dialogue was often hard to follow (  I had trouble telling which of the 3 minds inside the scavanger's body spoke  ).   The current price (13.99 EUR) is too high. The game doesn't offer enough content to justify it.  ",-1,0
1849495,231200,Kentucky Route Zero,"I can't get into this game, I like games with story, heck I loved day of the tentacle and the telltale games, the dig, there are a bunch of, sadly msotly older, point and click adventures out there that makes you hunger for more, but this game is simply..boring.  For example the first guy you meet you can randomly ask him if he likes poetry, that makes no sense at this stage of the conversation, however later one you find out he uses peotry as a password, the longest password in the existance of mankind I guess, nothing you do or say seems to change the outcome either, sure you can give your dog a name and gender, but it has no impact on what is happening, sure you can create your 'own' story along, but I still have the feeeling that nothing matters.  What is worse is that I have the feeling this game is the classic 'you were dead all along' you can visit a crashsite if you drive were you came from and your character even muses about how 'atleast it wasn't us' then people disappearing in seconds, the hard cuts that take away all immersion just to potray another titlecard to show you a new act began.  The game doesn't have the draw for me, I have the feeling at the end its just going to be a boring cliche ending, because I do not trust the writters to come up with something original and because of that I'm simply not willing to invest more time into it.",-1,0

A friend and I bought the game when it was 9.99 and so far we have enjoyed playing co-op. However this does not mean that the game is without major issues. After 2 years of the release, the game still hasn't been balanced. The Germans have the far better side of the stick which lead much of the online player base to lean German factions. The Ai at times can be supper frustrating since 70% of the time they rush engineers with flame throwers and spam a bunch of cheap units, In coh1 points could be defended and games were balanced. However in this game it is much harder to hold territory experientially if the other side has better units then you. Games don't last more then 30 minutes if you're playing as the Russians most guides will tell you that they only way to win is to build up a army fast and kill the enemy before they get tanks which is hard since you have to struggle to get points. Over all this is a decent game that needs to be rebalanced, and if your have coh1 already you should just stick with it unless you can get it on sale.",1,0

1858806,231430,Company of Heroes 2,"237 hours in, time to finally write a review. -More DLC content than base game -There's literally DLC for DLC, I'm not joking. Buy a faction, they buy the commanders to use that faction's good units, then optional skins but I'm not even going to count those. -You wanna get all the DLC? Over $100 and that's not counting skins. -You want to hear more BS about DLC you need to buy the King Tickle DLC complaint DLC pack. -Relic Entertainment bullies people who criticize their game, via deleting comments and banning on their official forums. -Also emphasizes all positive comments... Relic? More like Reich Entertainment.  -Reich Entertainment barely even cares about the game, leaving the game unbalanced and censoring balance complaints until things get bad enough for them to finally fix something in a patch.  -Slight Axis bias. Yes, for the longest time and even a bit still now the Axis factions (Wehrmacht mainly) have had more utility and stronger units/abilities that give them the upper hand. Calls for balancing were of course censored by the glorious Reich Entertainment.  -Finally, the game itself is fairly lackluster in entertainment unless you have a group of friends to party up with. Online matchmaking can only last so long for the solo gamer and getting over ranked by the countless prestige 3 level 100s happens more often than not. Frustrating and lackluster sums it up nicely.  Conclusion: I've given up on the game other than private matches with friends for fun. If you want more info and less sardonicsm in a review I highly reccomend you check out Optimism's review, he breaks down the game more and is also one of the friends I party up with.

I gave this game a thumb down not because I don't like it.I love COH.I love to play this game with my friends at weekend.I love to fight againse ai when I'm bored.    HOWEVER  ,I'm really sick of someyhing in the game,which really disappoints me.  First of all,I don't know why SEGA do not release Chinese version,neither simplified nor traditional.Yes,maybe it will not earn much money to realse Chinese version,since there will be more people buying this game in Czech &amp; Poland(you know what I mean).What's more,why do you suppress Chinese language patch.There's a joke in China:  --When will the Company of heroes 2 upgrade next time? --Maybe when SEGA finds the latest Chinese language patch released.   I don't want to talk about this much since many Chinese people have complaint about this many times.If SEGA continues to treat Chinese market like this,it will lose the whole Chinese market one day.  What I want to talk about next is the compaign.I like the USSR,and I do know some bad things done by USSR in WW2,such as what happened in Katyn and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ women in Berlin.But we have to admit the contributions of USSR in WW2.I don't know who write this script which is filled with foolish plots to discredit USSR.All characters in the compaign do lot of foolish things to show how bad USSR is and how good the FREE WORLD is.But sorry,  what I have seen is a group of foolish people wants to tell us how foolish people in the FREE WORLD will be when they try to discredit USSR.  I think any normal people will know how silly the script is if they read the history of WW2.I can't believe nobody in the campaign never suspect the political commissar who always executed soliders is a spy from German.That's impossible.Don't tell me you know very well about the order 227.DO YOU KNOW THAT MOST POLITICAL COMMISSARS WERE KILLED WHEN THEY LEAD THEIR SOLIDERS CHARGING FORWARD.DO YOU KNOW THAT MOST DESERTERS WERE ACTUALLY SENT BACK TO THEIR TROOPS WITH ONLY EXECUTING THE FIRST ONE TO FLEED.DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO FRANCH ARMY IN WW1 WHEN THEY SHOOT DESERTERS IN THE FRONTLINE WITH MACHINE GUN.there are so many silly plots that I can't tell them all.

1859180,231430,Company of Heroes 2,"I think it's time I am more honest about my views on Company of Heroes 2. I was hesitant originally because I am a huge fan of the series. While the original Company of Heroes including its expansions were a worthwhile and thrilling experience I cannot say the same for Company of Heroes 2.  Compared to the original, Company of Heroes 2 has quickly evolved into a huge cash cow that offers very little to players whom only buy just the game. The focus on the DLC and charging players for it every time is disgusting and very disappointing. I truly felt that Company of Heroes 2 could have become an amazing title. Instead Relic's focus is only on making the most money possible with very little return the players. I have probably spent enough money on DLC for this game that I could have bought a 3 flagship titles.  I originally supported Relics effort because I saw promise in the series but as the title continued to evolve it became more and more apparent of Relic's and/or Sega's focus on profitability rather than making the game as good as and better than its predecessor. I will admit I am very disappointed in both Relic and Sega for essentially selling out the series in favor of this new model.  When it comes to gameplay, there have been some 'notable' DLC content released such as the Theatre of War mission packs along with DLC which introduced two new armies to the mix. All from which offer a very low return on investment and most importantly the quality of the DLC seems disappointing and otherwise incomplete.  Other DLC which includes commanders and skins are very disappointing. This is where I see the most disappointment with where the series is heading. The fact that you have to pay to get additional commanders in what should be unlocked during gameplay through a reward system is the only way this should be done. I also think that because of this players who pay will have an advantage over those whom don't. The skins are just a waste. They add no value other than making your units look prettier. To be honest I would just save the money and put it to upgrading your computer as needed to improve the visuals overall.  To be honest, new players may be interested in this title but the reality is I cannot recommend it in good conscience. If you get the game cheap and avoid buying DLC then I may recommend the game to play but the replay value is very limited. I found the game very repetitive and with the new rewards system I find my efforts are rarely rewarded for the loyalty I exhibit playing the game. While a nice addition of custom maps via Steam Workshop is nice there is a lot of room for improvement.  I am greatly disappointed with how Company of Heroes 2 has evolved. It could have become an amazing title but instead Relic and/or Sega opted to undertake a direction which ruins the series. If you want to try this title I would strongly encourage you to FIRST play the original and then try the second installment. I think many would agree the quality of the original is far superior to that of its successor.",-1,0

The matchmaker is unbalanced, putting you as a beginner almost consistently against very experienced players, making most matches everything but a fair fight. With all these sales there should be enough new players looking for a game, alas you'll hardly ever meet them. Granted, you can learn something from continuous defence and defeats, but getting out of the trenches against very experienced players will take many many hours of gameplay, and it's not the most fun you'll ever have being a punchbag all the time.

This is an easy bug to find and fix, I found this in my game 6 months ago, and is still there .  And there are other bugs: Your hero will randomly get stuck while moving from province to province, or it will automaticly fight an invisible army and die.   This kills your hero, you need to load a previos save and after 10-20 times you simply have enoght.   This game has many good ideeas, I like the mecanichs but with all this bugs ( and no fixing in sight), I can not recomend it.  Edit.

If you enjoy KF1, just keep playing that, and Pass on the sequel..... in KF1 you can just set it on 'Easy', and just mow down monsters and have fun, no pressure until you get to the Patriarch...but KF2, the lowest setting is 'Normal', which isn't too bad, until you get to Round 6....then it just gets WAAYY too crazy, especially for New Players. You can empty magazines into a crowd of monsters and you barely get any kills. It feels like your bullets do Zero damage unless shot at incredibly tight groups...just annoying. I mean that was the FUN part about KF1, is the 'spray and pray' strategy in the 'heat' of the battle...just doesn't apply anymore...so no perfectly planted shot, no kill basically! Garbage!  All it takes, is 'slightly' crappy team members...and you're dead. There's no line of defense anymore, it's too hard to maintain and takes away from the game play. A couple monsters jump in your Defense line, and break it up, and everyone runs off....The AI also spawn WAY too smart! They pretty much spawn on TOP of you sometimes....incredibly annoying! It reminds me of Left 4 Dead...just incredibly stupid and annoying!!!   In KF1, it felt like you were Hunting...now in KF2, it feels like YOU are being hunted...and all the spawn points are controlled to box you in, on purpose. Also, another REALLY big problem, is the maps.....they are small!!! There's no open spaces anymore, nowhere to stand out in the field and stand 'back-to-back' with you're buddies and mow down enemies, nowhere to Roam....terrible!!! It really pains me to give this a negative review, I absolutely LOVE KF1, still play it daily....but it MUST be said!!! KF2 has all the impressive graphics and action and speed of modern gaming, but lacks the pure team-play and exploration factor of KF1. Say what you want, but it's just Not the same...",-1,1

Everyone who likes a beautiful story should play this game.  My one criticism is that it's definitely too expensive for something that you'll finish inside a few hours.",1,0

1896610,232430,Gone Home,"I got this game in a bundle awhile ago and finally got around to playing it.  For a simple exploration simulator it isn't bad, the attention to detail is actually pretty amazing with all the little things you can interact with around the house. The detail on all the little notes, even the ones you might miss completely encourage thorough exploration.  Unfortunately the game has some pretty major issues which prevent me from recommending it.  1. Your character basically has nothing to do with the story, there's very little information around the house about your character and your character provides very little commentary on the whole situation so for the most part you could be a playing as a random stranger who ended up on the front porch for all I know.  2. The story has all the setup for some kind of horror/thriller, but ultimately ends up being a sappy (and I thought frankly stupid) teenage love story.  3. Short with no replay value. I exhaustively explored the house and you can see from my steam playtime how long that took. There are no randomized elements of any kind and no real puzzles to solve so for me there is really no reason to go back and play it.  4. Price. I got this as part of a bundle so I wasn't aware of the real price, but on coming here to write this review I had sticker shock. $20 for a game this short with no replay value is highway robbery. Even on a 75% off sale I couldn't recommend it with how many other excellent games can be had for under $5.",-1,0

After about 3-4 Journal entries you already know what's going to happen, but are left expecting more. It sets up for a very deep experience, but falls pretty flat.

1897562,232430,Gone Home,"This is game that sadly commits the worst sin of story telling imaginable; it TELLS you, rather than SHOWING you.  “Gone Home is what would happen if you took a click-and-point adventure game in the same vain as Deponia, and tried transferring it into a first person perspective. A game where you could [in theory] click on and interact with your game world in a dynamic way that makes that world feel alive. Gone home however has seemed to miss the biggest part those click-and-point adventure games had; a compelling story and actual interaction. Rather than focusing on characters that were interacting with each other, the player instead plays the cameraman. You as kaitlyn have no point in the story because you didn't have any interaction when the game starts. The game instead should have focused on the father coming home, only to realize his daughters gone and discover an entire world he really didn't know about. That would have been interesting because the father could have commented on his opinions and views of what happened, and we would have actually seen character development as the father realizes he'd done something wrong.  Instead, what they did is focus on a character who didn't have any major interaction and instead acts like the cameraman. It would have made more sense story wise if you weren't even in the game. The parents would have been interesting cameramen because they would have had revelations about their daughters world they largely ignored or pretended didn't exist, you as kaitlyn don't have that option because you weren't their to have those original interactions. Instead, the story entirely focuses on the wrong characters and the WRONG interactions. It committed a sin, and a game to focus solely on the story and have the story be a failure leaves little to grab onto.",-1,0

The suspense of the game solely arouse from not knowing what was going on.  - Though it was enjoyable pieceing together the narrative from little fragments you discovered of the family's life, the whole 'horror' game vibe goes out the window the instant you learn what this game is really about.   If this game's developers and the Slenderman: The Arrival team had worked together on a game then you would've had a healthy mix of subtle story-telling, suspense, and a small element of jump scares.

FX6350 3.9Ghz/4.2ghz and RadeonHD 7950 - This system is well above the needs of this poorly graphically desgined game (seriously low graphics for 2013 but I don't care about that, I only care about gameplay - saying this because it doesnt make sense on my machine that this looks like crap.) Game runs at about 80-110 fps but looks like utter ♥♥♥♥ unless it's running at 120fps solid (i don't understand why this is) - when I turn on vysnc it runs at 60 which is what i want as i use a 60hz monitor but it looks like a game running below it's intended frame rate = extremely jittery. If they find a way of ironing this out it would be a great game but it is unplayable in it's current state on my machine - which runs Battlefield 4 / Tomb Raider on High at 60fps solid and Ultra with an average of 55fps, 2 much more demanding games than this. I have checked the internet for a fix to this problem for this game but despite numerous people complaining of this (on both Nvidia and AMD cards) there is no fix and doesn't seem to be any effort from the developer to release a fix.   From what I have been able to play the gameplay is great fun, very good fun, comically violent and bloody - good chinese martial artsy feel despite the guns but is held back by the fact it is unplayable on my machine. Let me re-itterate - on a 60hz monitor this game has to run at 120fps solid to actually not look jittery, a 7950 is not a weak graphics card and it cannot run this at 120fps solid, about 100 yes but I am not kidding - any less than 120 and it looks like a game intended to run at 60fps running at 30fps - very, very choppy and jittery.",-1,0

Some of the AI of the units and commander itself needs some improvements, some rendering issues here and there, and other bugs can be fixed.  Though, despite the known issues, this is a very good looking game. Rendering and the lighting in this game is remarkable, and I haven't seen such great lighting in games for a while now until I came across this one. The aspect of this game is fun, and easy to get used too, and single player can be fun as well, as long as you have an internet connection.

They don't have to 'think' and plan like us, so they often can build a vast army and attack faster than you. They also go straight to air and build a massive air force to fly in an assault you.   If they are on another planet, by the time you advance your tech to get you to other planet, their air force will most likely take you out before you can get a foothold.   I've played a number of games, and the AI is always the same. Straight to air force and very fast build up of defenses.   Occasionally, I've been able to defeat the enemy if I catch him roaming or we are on the same planet and I take him out quickly.  I would give it a 2 out of 10.

1938746,233290,MURDERED: SOUL SUSPECT™,"well here is my opnion about the game, short version its a 6/10 a most decent game but still average.  its a crime mystery game, with a ghost main character, you are supposed to find your killer.  cons about the game: - very simple and quite easy to beat - i saw someone else down in the review call the combar for 'hide and seek combat' which i agree with - You cant make a mistake that will have any huge consequence if any at all - very simple side missions can be solved very fast - NPC's have only 2 lines when possesed and some of them have the same 2 lines - at times its way to quiet and feels to empty in the areas  Pros about the game: - The main cast is very nicely voiced and are in general nice characters - the story is really good, and interesting - have a nice twist - secret stories i can recomend to find - nice settings, it all seems haunted (but at times it feel to empty and quiet)  but still i can recomend the game when its on sale it is very decent and worth the money and time, i hope i helped your choice to either buy the game or not :D",1,0

1939938,233290,MURDERED: SOUL SUSPECT™,I had more fun than most I think with this game. If you enjoy being a ghost and wearing a fedora then go for it! I did! Im a sucker for detective noir and this game had me at the trailer.   Pros: Fun main character and puzzles and collectables that are just difficult enough to not be annoying to find/solve. Story and mythos of the area is pretty good too. Make sure to explore a lot to get the full price of the game.  Cons: Cheaply made. the demons are just ew. SO cheap! I wish they did them better. Very repetitave. Could have made them scarier and with different versions of them instead of the same thing over and over again. ugh. THAT really annoyed me.  Other than that it's decent. Don't buy at full price though. I paid 14 bucks and was happy.,1,0
1940195,233290,MURDERED: SOUL SUSPECT™,"I wanted to play this game since before it was out but it was far too expensive for me. I finally bought it in a bundle for 1$. :D   Generally I like it, mostly 'cause it's just my kind of game, however there are some things I really dislike.  1. It's a casual game. All the riddles are easy, it's not challenging enough.  2. If you do by some miracle make a mistake you get another (and another and another..) go at it or just restart from the last checkpoint (and there a lot of checkpoints). There should be some repercussions for wrong decisions.  3. Does he really have to move so slowly in and out of locations? It takes him 5 min to exit the museum, even though he just goes through the fence. Most of that time he just tries to act all cool and poses in hope of a screenshot.   4. What's with the flashbacks? The white screen that flashes made my eyes hurt. :( Do not play in the dark, might end up blind. The game is kind and gentle, takes care of you, gives you a bunch of retries and then *SNAP* makes you blind every time someone remembers something. Why do you betray my trust, game?  There is, however, a nice story to it, some nice twists, nice atmosphere and all that jazz.  I'd say 7,5/10.  It's not worth the whole price (as most games aren't) but I recommend buying it on sale or in a bundle.",1,0

And then, the big bug, an important screwdriver that I pick up doesn't appear in my bag. Impossible to use it, it doesn't exist, and without it I can't keep on the game.  I reloaded 3 times my last auto-save but the problem is still here. So I have to stop the game or to begin again, knowing that this game has many other bugs which aren't fixed, a lot of people are complaining about it.

1951349,233450,Prison Architect,"Do you want to hear a story of my most memorable moment in this game? No, well sit down and shut the f#ck up because im going to tell it anyways. It all started when I recieved a minimum security prisoner, 'JH 'Devastator' Quack'. He was my favorite, I gave him a giant cell, nice food and all the things you need. As I got more prisoners, he started to turn...odd. I didn`t think anything of it until he one punched my Warden, Chief, Accountant, Foreman, Psychologist, and lawyer. Instantly shoved him up to SuperMax, The moment he got out of solitary he killed a guard and proceeded to open every cell and started a riot. I hired 18 armed guards and set them to freefire. Quack took 3 shots and got knocked unconsious, woke up and killed more guards. I started to like Quack and got attached to him, so I build a small SuperMax cell block and game him his own solitary cell, canteen, and a DeathRow prisoner to play with. That DeathRow prisoner is dead now. So far he has killed atleast 40 prisoners, 20 guards, 5 armed guards, and took many baton hits, tazer shots, a whole fire that almost burnt my whole prison down, and around 80 shotgun shots. Quack is like an abusive relationship, it hurts you more than it, but you love it anyways, Now he has two SuperMax friends, Dan Q who is a magician that teleported all the money in a bank away, and Felix 'Pewdiepie'Kjellberg (no lie, I can send screenshots) who is in prison who killed his dog Edgar. They are all best of friends. god I love this game.",1,0

When expanding you'll add more advanced security, manage logistics, building an export business and teaching prisoners. During all of this continious expanding you'll find yourself dealing with fights, escape attempts, riots and other incidents. Even some micromanagement comes in place.  The game has a lot to offer.

You're Clink the game's hero on your search you find Kaeris together you must save the world (if you played FF 7 you will love all the references), as you progress through the story the game evolves, from 2d graphics black and white, to 8 bit colors, 3d , hd textures, prerenders etc. On the world map and some caves the combat is turn based like retro final fantasy games, don't expect a pletora of spells though, and most places you play like legend of zelda top down view, in some places you even switch from retro to 3d to sort the puzzles. There's also a mini card game called double twin, it plays like final fantasy 8 card game, but with less complicated stuff and you can't lose your cards, which you find in secret chests in the world. The game is easily worth the full price for any rpg fan, specially if you played zelda or/and final fantasy games, it can be beaten in 3 to 4 hours depending how much side content you decide to complete.",1,0

Even switching them to something more my play style made this game strange and not at all streamlined to play.   I clocked less than an hour into this game before giving up the ghost.

I still believe this is a great game, an awesome game, a supreme blast and loads of fun...  BUT: Game went from owerwhelmingly positive to very positive, and for me too.  The best is for me the wasteland, the scenario is utterly inspiring and really really cool.  There IS one thing that lowered my opinion quite a lot: the survival aspect.   How cool it would have been if the initial pressure of surviving remained a bit longer. Instead, you level up without even noticing nor wanting it, and your character is MAXed a lot earlier than the middle of the game.   I thought several hours ago in the game that a realistic difficulty, a 'Fallout: New Vegas Hardcore Difficulty' was missing in this game. Now I am absolutely convinced this lack is a flaw.  What if all that scrap scrap everywhere scrap would have been components instead,  or the lack of water and oil was a bit more preminent, more crucial?  What was good, remains good:  The relics (THIS is the best for me: to see pictures and words of the vanished world we still live in, for now). I look behind every stone in the desert for those.  The storms!  THAT is what I'd like the game to be: a struggle for survival more than a normal action movie that it is.  A bit more of madness: that's what this (almost a) masterpiece lacks.  More Mad and less Max.  On the other hand, once you own the game USE the screenshot editor, because it adds a solid +50% of fun to the game.",1,1
1979814,234140,Mad Max,"It would be easy to nit-pick Mad Max to death for its repetitive design, flimsy plot, sometimes painfully slow upgrade progress, and Max’s pathetic little jump. However, when the chips are down you have a game that is just a lot of fun to play, even when you are doing the fairly mundane side tasks. The game plays well, runs well, and doesn’t make you worry about whether you should really be spending thirty minutes chasing down a convoy in place of going off to do the next story mission. Instead, it actively encourages you do deviate from the main path, and you will probably find yourself gleefully doing so, constantly getting distracted by scrap-transports, camps, convoys and scavenging locations; even when you tell yourself its finally time to drive to the next story quest marker.

1993490,234330,Marvel Puzzle Quest,"I think the reviews for this game thus far have been a little harsh.   Yes, there are ample microtransactions, and at times you do feel like there's nothing to do if you want to recruit that rare hero card you just got, because there's no other way to expand your stable without spending coins bought with real money.  However, its also not your average match 3 game. The heroes have special attacks which use differing amounts of the gems you collect from matching them. This means using more complicated gameplay than just matching tiles until one side emerges the victor. Environment tiles add an additional layer of gameplay, but this game isn't the type you'll play all night, every night- and shouldn't be judged as such.   As a lover of marvel, I enjoy the variety of heroes they've incorporated so far and am looking forward to more. I also think the artwork is nice, but do agree there is little feeling of story progression as you go from battle to battle.  All in all, I enjoy this game. There are various improvements I could suggest, but instead I'll just log on from time to time, have a few fights and enjoy myself, level up my characters a bit with the currency I gain from my wins and then log back off and do something else.  If you take offence at microtransactions then don't click the page with them on, but if you're a grown up and understand that the option is there but is by no means a neccessity, then by all means, give the game a try- it's worth a look if you're a fan of Marvel and match 3 games.",1,0

I would score this highest out of any of my racing games, a true petrol heads dream, if you are on the fence, dont be, go for it, you won't regret it if you are a true car/motorsports fan, thumbs up",1,1
1998598,234630,Project CARS,"This game is so much fun. It is the first driving sim I've ever played, and I can tell this is something I will be doing for a long time. I bough a used Logitech Driving Force GT steering wheel, and it works great with the game. The car selection is awesome. Carts to F1, amazing road cars, GT cars, and classic cars. The tracks are fantastic. I have a lot of fun just doing time trials in various cars to see how I stand up against other people on the Nurburgring Nordschleife. Career mode is a lot of fun, you can start in whatever driving discipline you want, then at the end of the season decide if you want to move up, or stay the same. The AI is really good. I like being able to change their skill level so easily. I can get pole position at AI 70 most of the time now. The tuning options for each vehicle are fantastic. It is definitely difficult to get the hang of tuning, and find good set ups, but there is plenty of help online. Overall I highly recommend this game to anyone who has an interest in driving sims.",1,0

1999822,234630,Project CARS,"Maybe it's because I grew up playing the original Gran Turismo that I'm so critical of all racing games today, as nothing will compare to the greatest racing sim of all time. I would recommend this game ONLY if the price drops.   Pros  -Stunning graphics, A+++ This is what sold me on it. -Challenging gameplay and plenty of room to adjust difficulty based on your skill level. Just one mistake could easily send you to the back of the pack.  -Nice 'free race' allows you to skip to any track and set weather conditions with any car from the start. This really helped aid me in getting a feel for the controls.   Cons  -Unrewarding single player mode, win after win I'm in my 3rd season and still racing with the same car. Soon found myself aching to get the season over with. -Not a great variety of 'regular' everyday cars, mostly f1 cars. Biggest complaint overall with the game is there are not enough Japanese cars, NO Hondas, NO Subarus, NO Nissans, and the only American make is Ford. FORD!!! Would it really have been so hard to include just one Chevy? Selection is limited, the only car I was really stoked about was the Lancer EVO.  -Radio voice throughout race is okay at first but fastly becomes repetitive and annoying. -No option to customize the visual appearance of your car, only change the color IF you aren't driving a vehicle that's sponsored by your racing team. No need to upgrade parts as all cars are track ready. -Other drivers speed and handling are not as affected when run off the track and often times their aggression has knocked me off the track and caused unfair penalties.  -NO 2 playerr split screen :( I work at night and the multiplayer servers are pretty limited at 3am.  Neutral  -Tuning vehicles can be tedious and aggravating when all you wanna do is drive and there is a learning curve to this but there's an option to turn on driving and brake assists  -Could be a negative but there is no music.

2002092,234650,Shadowrun Returns,"DRAGONFALL analysis:  Pros: - Great story - Immersive setting - Interesting characters - Nice, strategic, turn-based combat  Cons: - The game does not explain anything to you. For example, there are these ley lines things on the ground, that somehow improve magical abilities. However, the game does not explain this to you, and nor does it say HOW your magic is improved. This is just an example, because you have to pretty much figure everything out by yourself here. - The NPCs don't cover every role/class possible (like in games such as Dragon Age). This is actually not a big deal, but I started the game as a Shaman (summoner/support mage), only to find that the game already provides you with one, but not with a damage-oriented mage. You can hire some mercenaries to fill those roles by paying cash, but I don't think this solves the problem. - The items/spells systems are not clear and have some pretty big flaws, and as I stated before, nothing is explained to you. Two examples: 1) You can by spells/armor for yourself, but not for your companions, but no one tells you that. At the same time, you can buy consumables for them. 2) If you equip an ally with a consumable before a mission, the item will be lost after the quest, even if you didn't used it.  Even if its flaws, I must reccommend this game for anyone who's fond of turn-based strategy games (it plays a bit similar to XCOM) or who likes a game with great story. Just be sure to read a guide or something before playing.",1,0
2003380,234650,Shadowrun Returns,"Undoubtedly beautiful, quite immersive and relatively nonlinear. The greatest drawback of this game is the p&amp;p RPG system it's built upon.

Personal buttrage aside, it is a smooth and decently long RPG with a good albeit uninteresting combat system.

The game play works well enough and it's a plesant diversion but there's so much potential left untapped. Eniorments are barren and dialogue trees sparse.

Those disks tend to be outdated the day you recieve them because the product has been sitting in trucks/shelves/werehouses for a year or two before they reach the consumer.   Your milage will varry, as I see many satisfied reviewers. The best thing it does is gives you a system restore point when it starts its work. Overall my review is indifferent. It's a reasonable product and a great idea to keep your PC current, however, as the program itself is not kept current, there's an inherent risk.

2020874,235540,Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide,"&gt; Experimentally trying to integrate VR into their game instead of fixing the MOUNTAINS of bugs and issues (like ♥♥♥♥ fps) that's been plaguing the baseline game since release. My. Fùcking. Word.  -  A game that has a series of unfortunate problems, many of them originating from the L4D franchise from which this game has been designed from. Not to say that the core experience makes it a bad game by any means, the melee and gore is very satisfying when It works but there's just too many glaring problems for me to personally enjoy it for more than a few hours at a time and following an incredibly bug-filled release that yet remains to be fixed, the developers have also gone out of their way to mislead the community by announcing how they have such 'BIG PLANS' for the game just to utterly STRUGGLE to release the world's weakest DLC including 3 maps, 3 achievments and 2 new weapons (one which is for an already horrendously overplayed character, they've done zero effort to try and balance the 5 that currently exist) that cost 10€ whilst leaving the old maps that are bugged to all hell in the dust with even weaker updates inbetween fixing nothing but crashes that should have been solved at release.  As for the actual game design / mechanical problems, I'm gonna list these now:   ------------------  1. Melee range of Skaven. These little buggers can be armed with tiny rotten planks barely poking out of their hands and still whack you from over 5 bodylengths away. Mix this with the fact that they can effortlessly hit you through massive chunks of walls (even floors/ceilings) and you got a recipe for frustration. HP is precious like all hell and having huge amounts of it be lost to quite frankly bull sh*t scenarios is a big no-no and these frustrations are only reinforced by the constant clumsy slow-downs all character suffer from before, during and after weapon swings that cannot be alleviated in the slightest even with a potion of speed which breaks the melee combat pacing. To put it in numbers, Skaven are as of right now hitting about 20-60% further away than they should be (depending on the Skaven). Now mix this with some very buggy skaven animations including warping, pushing/stun immunity when climbing, clipping into walls &amp; objects and you're goinna have a bad time.  This is an issue that has been openly admitted by the developers themselves. One of the leading causes for this is the FOV which makes no attempt whatsoever to adapt melee ranges you perceive above 65 FOV which has for whatever reason been made the standard, an incredibly dumb decision for a melee oriented messy fighting game.  ----  2. Hitboxes. Contributing to point 1, the enemy hitboxes in this game are excruciatingly random. They can either be non-existant, allowing you to merge your body with theirs (and have their body physically fade out of existance as they repeatedly hit you) or have 2-3 of the weakest grunts be able to flawlessly box you in at giant open areas. Both scenarios are much unwelcome things to be had in a melee fighter so collission as of right now remains to be a serious problem of not only consistency and flow often breaking up in fights but also managing to nick the weapon balance in the game. If you collide with a teammate, they will get pushed around. If skaven collide with themselves, they will just clip into each-other and form grotesquely durable glitchy meatshields that even I, a main dwarf player struggle to take down with dozens of full power cleaves using a 2h battle-axe. Have just a few common skaven glitch inside of a rat ogre and.. Well.. You're gonna have a bad time.  ----  3. Battle Clutter. There are literally hundreds of enemies swarming you from all directions at any given time while you are cramped up together with 3 other friendly melee fighters.. And there is absolutely no indication or outliners whatsoever to help you see amidst the sea of corpses and blood that if the thing you are hitting is a friendly or a non-dead Skaven as all characters currently in the game suffer from 'Skaven Lookalike Syndrome' with perhaps only the Empire Soldier being an exception due to his height &amp; shiny plate and decapitated Skaven splurting significant amounts of blood to form an improvised lamp post. When you combine the hitbox clutter from point 2, however, It also becomes increasingly difficult to differentiate between dead, injured and alive Skaven from even moderate attack groups as they all die in dramatic'esque animations &amp; poses before ragdolling onto the ground. This wouldn't be a problem if you could actually have an effect on these animations by say, pushing them away/cancelling them by swinging your weapon into said ragdolls but instead, they all individually have to stand up and have their incredibly frustrating 'vision obscuration' sequence before GTFO'ing. There's also an ongoing series of glitches that make Skaven ragdolls stand upright, even when dead which makes this all much more frustrating. But even then, bodies obscure way too much of the screen which forces you (in even moderate fights) to adapt a spam-swinging strategy instead of trying to get a grasp of a situation.  ----  4. Loot &amp; Inventory system leaves much to be desired. After my very first run with my friend playing the Soldier, I had the absurd luck to have a blue rare two-handed sword for said Empire Soldier to drop for me as I was playing as a Wizard while my friend got a staff. Could we trade the two things? NNNNNNNNNNnnnnope. Salvage that crap and better luck rolling the loot dice next time. To put it bluntly, It's a zero flexibility 100% RNG loot system that makes no attempt whatsoever to give you loot related to the hero you were playing that run and It's just a giant questionmark for me as to why they would ever consider this to be good design for a co-op RPG released late 2015. It is particularly crippling because there is literally no other customization to be had to for example, make your character stronger or enable him/her to carry more ammo etc.  ----  5. Level design. The first map is beautiful with far-reaching scenery and big atmospheric battle-grounds when you're not crunching through blood-soaked urban quarters. After that, however, you're thrown into a series of horribly generic sewer sections that all look identical save for the 2~ gate opening sections. Following the smelly sewers, you're shot right back up into a ginormously downsized version of map 1 that is nothing but the same cramped urban areas where the only even remotely open area at ALL in the entire map is at the end where you have to go and pick up 5 bags of grain, slowly carrying them one by one to a wagon before getting in yourself and finishing all the early access content. This boring trend has continued with the release maps and they all also follow the consensus of being INCREDIBLY buggy, both having you fall down the map on a dozen locations, be dragged outside of it by packmasters and have drastic FPS drops happen consistently.  ----  6. The AI. It is either insanely dumb or insanely cheaty &amp; unfair. For the dumb scenarios I've met, I had all the rats at the end of map 1 try to run up the stairs, targeting only my furthest-back teammate and completely ignoring me as I was slaughtering them en-masse by charging up cleave attacks over and over again. They even repeatedly collided with me and didn't give a damn, allowing us to roll through what would've been a challenging fight. I've also had it blatantly SPAM spawn enemy Skavens right infront of our faces nearby an elevator close to a corner, popping them in by the hundreds and causing them to glitch around in eachother and up against the walls which we took advantage of and slaughtered hundreds of them over and over again with ease before It abruptly stopped. This may not be a big deal on a case-by-case basis but It definitely is a cause of worry as the rest of the released game remains to be grossly untested.",-1,1

2023116,235540,Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide,"I stood up and went to grab a drink after another intense round of Vermintide. I had some punishing rounds where the tide turned in favor of the Skaven in the blink of an eye. And on the other hand I found a group that didn't seem to mind carrying me while I try to gain some levels and get some better gear. After all this, the thought ocurred to me: Vermintide is repetitive. I immediately had a flash of disappointment.  My initial impression was probably the chemical aftermath in my brain. My first few rounds I was frantically scanning rooftops or looking over my shoulder worrying another rat was crawling out of a crack in the walls. It didn't take long before I was ready to start charging up a power attack when I felt like a rat was behind me. My eyes were darting across the screen, I was constantly worrying about keeping up with my teammates, or rushing to someone who had fallen. After my first experience playing, I was probably recovering from the intensity of NORMAL. I should have started on easy, but I'm glad I didn't. I got to see how difficult and chaotic things can be from a random group. I also got to feel that surge of excitement from a well organized vicory after a crushing defeat.  When I was cramming in a round before work the following moring, I thought: being repeatedly amazing is just what I want from a new release. The satisfying *splak* of my axe swinging into a rat man's neck, picking off a Packmaster before he pulls one my teammates down an alley, and attempting to stand my ground to a rat ogre are just a few things that I could do all day.  The sound in Vermintide is very well done. The voice acting from the character is entertaining and helpful. The ominous sounds that surround you are enough to increase your heart rate. You can hear the sinister voices of Gutter Runners while they wait in the shadows ready to pounce on an unsuspecting noob like myself. When you hear the horn in the distance you might immediately realize you need to close the gap between you and your teammates.  Pair the sound with the dark and gritty feel visuals and you've got a fantastic immerision into the Warhammer universe. The cities are on fire and abandoned, aside from a rat in every corner.You really do feel like one of the last remaining shreds of hope to expel the Skaven menace.   My reaction to complaints I read:  *Dislaimer - the game hasn't officially been released for a week yet and I don't have 40 hours into the game yet.*   Hitboxes:  Yeah they could probably use some polishing, but the QQing I read made it feel like it was totally unfair and broken. Most of the Skaven have spears you imbeciles! Of course they're going to outrange you.   Loot System:  I wish someone had a tag over their head that said: 'I'm only here for the loot,' because I would immediately kick them or drop group. The game is damn fun; the loot will accrue over time.   Buggy:  First week of release and a small studio, waahh. I'm going to take the side of the developers (as long as I trust them to correct them eventually.) They really seem like they're making an effort in the community. I've come across a couple things that were a little obnoxious (getting hit through walls, for example,) but nothing that prevented me from wanting to queue up another round.

I think the only negative thing i can point to at the moment of playing this BETA is that there is no option to customize the look of your character apart from the hat/helmet. I would love to earn new clothes to switch things up.  I've not noticed any big bugs in the BETA yet, so i have to give credit to the team at Fatshark for making a BETA that actually feels like a retail release. Comparred to how buggy a lot of other games are at this stage now a days, that is impressive in my book.   Grab this and go play with your friends. 10/10",1,0
2024894,235540,Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide,"Don't like it a bit. It feels heavy and slow, and it's basically just a rip off from L4D, even with the same type of special mobs!!",-1,0
2025309,235540,Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide,"*review made on last day of pre-release beta* *refunded as of 23/10*  Left 4 Dead meets Chivalry with rats and no PvP  Not bad as horde games go, there are better ones (Killing floor, L4D Borderlands Underdome mode, MW coop) If it wasn't set in the Warhammer world I doubt very much that people would be playing this game, it's not bad, it's also not remotley original or special, sure the gfx are nice but visuals have never been a priority for me, gameplay is, the special mobs are basically the same as L4D, which is frankly dissapointing.  Personally I stopped playing L4D because of the community (rambos and toxic kids mostly) unfortunatley this game is no different, the last 2 beta events before pre release were ok, pre release beta brought masses of elitists and poor players who don't want to be taught how to play (I hosted every game I played so inb4 salty coz u got kicked lolol), I can see this game becoming basically the same and with Fatshark's reputation I can see them doing nothing to address the issues.  If you must play this game, I reccomend you play with people you know., if your'e a Games Workshop fanboy you probably already bought it...  One positive thing this game has over L4D is the feeling of immersion given by the xp and loot systems (although the xp is basically just unlocking slots)",-1,1
2025310,235540,Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide,"  I could only bare to play this game for a handful of sessions. It was completely boring and derivative. Everything in it is ripped wholesale from Left 4 Dead right down to the animations that characters do while using their medpacks. The suspension of disbelief did not last long, at least, for me.  Even the special Skaven are exact duplicates of the special infected from L4D2 but make far less sense. When a smoker is literally strangling you with a tentacle it makes sense that you might not be able to free yourself without help. But why is my veteran, dwarf ranger just standing there flailing his arms like an idiot just because there's a hook resting on his shoulder? We're talking about a guy who survives the harshest wilderness climates alone and fights off massive, wild beasts on a daily basis but one Skaven with a hook weapon is too much, I guess.  These may seem like a petty complaints from the outside but the game is loaded with things like that and it just all piles up into a mess. The game tells you 'Get to the watch tower!' but doesn't tell you where that is. There's a section where Skaven will endlessly spawn until you blow up a door with some barrels of gunpowder which, stops them for some reason. But again, the game tells you nothing so unless you just happen to see the gunpowder and then figure it out yourself, you'll be there for a long time just fighting and dying. On top of all this the gameplay is rather dull and extremely repetative. The only thing that spices it up is trying out the different characters, the loot system and, different maps of which there are few.  Just to end my rant I'll mention that Vermintide is also a $30 title with full priced DLC and no workshop or modding support. I absolutely loved Left 4 Dead and I'm a massive Warhammer fan but I had to force myself to play this game. That says pretty much everything you need to know about it.",-1,0

2027284,235540,Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide,"Ah, Vermintide.....  Let me clear things beforehand:   I am a Warhammer fan, i play the tabletop and have read a few novels. Pretty much all Warhammer games that have come out were either really bad or just not my type of game. These last few years, more Warhammer titles have come out (BloodBowl, Mordheim) and it seems they are improving overall. Vermintide is absolutely one of them, so lets get on with the review:    For starters, if you liked L4D and L4D2 you wont be disappointed. It is indeed a very close relative to that good old Valve franchise (something like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ brother comes to mind) In that light, Fatshark has done everything right. The gameplay is tight, the design is polished, ambiance is outstanding, just like L4D. The entire atmosphere is exactly as in the Warhammer lore, it oozes proper Warhammer feeling and that is awesome. It is gritty, it is unfriendly, raw and dark. Combined with the artwork, graphical design, which is astounding and of high quality it just makes it a pleasure to run around in the areas available. What bit of lore you can pick up in-game (unfortunately it is not much) is completely coherent with how Warhammer has been unfolding over the last year.  Now for the gameplay, like i said, it is tight. Everything feels right. Sure there are some bugs and glitches. Sure there are some maps that have exploits, sure there are balancing issues between the characters. But who cares? i dont.... Its a co-op game to the bone, where skill and routine trumps everything. There is a lootsystem which makes it RPG-ish but its very minimal and you shouldnt focus on it. No doubt about it, the upgraded weapons will help you alot and they are absolutely needed in the Nightmare/Cataclysm mode but it will (fortunately) never be a game where items win the game. Even with the crappier weapons, if youre a good player, you can make it. On the hardest modes its all about not getting hit, so thats only skill based, both in movement and in blocking/hitting.  I can underrstand some people that get bored, after having done all maps on easy/normal/hard a few times, you will be doing the same 8-9 maps all the time. It can feel like a grind, especially if you are focussing on getting new items. To me, i just play it like L4D, its a challenge everytime, especially nightmare and cataclysm.  Despite a few glitches and bugs i really love this game. Matter of fact, i love all about it, even its glitches and bugs.  100% recomendation",1,0

Edit:In order to play online I had to use another Uplay account which would be frustrating for those of us who played other Ubisoft games.Now then,the online portion is not too bad,for veterans the classic mode is a welcome gametype.The mercenary vision modes are pretty much gone,have been substituted by passive upgrades to your helmet and you can only have one at a time I beleive.Unless I am crazy there is also no flashlight in blacklist mode for mercs either.You can get melee kills on mercs from all sides rather than just from behind,something Im torn about but with the gameplay changes it makes more sense.What I think is really dumb is how they made the AK47 the most powerful rifle in the game even though the SA58 shoots a bigger bullet.  You can also use SMGs and pistols as a spy but they are best used as a distraction depending on the amount of armor the Merc has.The moving between cover system is also gone for the spies in multiplayer. I think they did a better job with tailoring single player to the new pacing they set for the game.There are some action sequences that seem like a direct confrontation is inevitable but you can still take them out with stealth if you are careful.While Ironside is gone I wish they at least got a older sounding voice actor for Sam.This game just took what they did with Conviction and made it all better with the exception of the context sensitive controls.Still it fails to reach the bar Chaos Theory has set and I doubt any other Splinter Cell they make will ever do that again.I would not recommend this for those who loved splinter cell before conviction unless you got it on sale like I did.",-1,0

2032280,235800,Audiosurf 2,"When I first played Audiosurf 2, I expected it to be pretty much like the original, only flashier. This was not a bad thing, as the original game had eveything pretty much correct and further aesthetics could only serve to make the game better. Unfortunately, instead of adding stronger aesthetics, Audiosurf 2 did the exact opposite. Simply by loading it up, the menu appeared very unpolished, the gameplay felt stagnant, and the visuals were bland at best. This was in contrast to the original's flashy title, fluid and immersive gameplay, and cool backgrounds which moved to the music, adding to the experience.   All of that, however, was early on in Audiosurf 2's Early Access period and I decided to wait for a full release for a final judgement. Now that the game has been fully released, I can now say this: not much has changed. The menu is still boring, the gameplay is still anything but fluid or immersive, and the background visuals have disappeared. Audiosurf 2 is practically a shadow of the original Audiosurf and a huge disappointment. If you come to this game looking for an awesome, immersive and new way to experience your music, stick to the original.  FINAL VERDICT: 4/10",-1,1

2032997,235800,Audiosurf 2,"Audiosurf 2 is an incredibly fun timewaster, and there isn't much else to it. Audiosurf 2 really is a rythem game at it's most basic, although in this case, that is not a bad thing. There is no objective, just pick a song and play, and that's really it. This is where the game falls flat, there just isn't a whole lot to do. The gamemodes are varied, which is nice, but there aren't multiple vehicles like in the first game which is a little disapointing. Mods are a definate must if you want to keep the game alive and interesting. Another problem is that the main menu seems downright broken at times. The character limit can be a real pain at times when it comes to searching for songs, not only that but somethimes you just can't find the song you are looking for, which is incredibly frustrating. So in the end Audiosurf 2 is a fun little timewaster, but with little variety and flaws that really do ruin the games enjoyment at times, it's nothing more.

2035071,23600,Depths of Peril,"Depths of Peril is an ARPG filled to the brim with unique ideas. From the premise of the game, where clans fight and adventure simultaneously for control of the region, to the randomly generated and adequately customizable game worlds. However, unique ideas alone cannot make a good game, and it is in the execution where Depths of Peril falls flat on its face. It isn't completely without merit, though, and I encourage anybody interested in making an ARPG of their own to at least take a look at the game, for the same idea in fully funded and capable hands is easily a recipe for success.  Unlike most other ARPGs, Depths of Peril doesn't contain a single game world that you advance through linearly; instead a new world can be generated for any of your characters to play in at any time. Each world has a number of 'covenants' (guilds of adventurers) that you can fight or ally with in an attempt to control the world. When only you and any allies you may have are the only ones remaining, the world is 'complete'. This world style allows the game to stay relatively fresh, but severely hampers the compelling story and exciting set boss fights common to others in the genre.  Depths of Peril manages to be like other ARPGs in many ways, though not all of them are positive. Quests in the world are randomly generated, often requiring you to kill enemies or find and rescue an NPC who you may then recruit to help you, two things which are also far too common in the genre. Also like other ARPGs, Depths of Peril suffers from some relatively uninteresting skills, few classes to choose from, all the flaws of random loot generation, and more.  The worlds themselves are uninspired and bland. The graphics are, as you can probably see from the screenshots and video available, not good, especially by today's standards. Even worse than that is how areas of each world will be literally squares of land with nothing separating them other than a small wall of some sort and a break in the wall to walk through. I'm not sure what kinds of forests and plains are perfectly square, but Depths of Peril has them in spades.  The most unique part of the game is, however, its strong point. Competing with other convenants for control is interesting and exciting, especially if you crank the difficulty enough for them to be a significant challenge (and cranking the difficulty up can easily be done). Attacking other covenants, however, is about as boring as can be, unfortunately; each covenant has a crystal that acts as a respawn and teleport point for its members, and you must destroy it to defeat the covenant. What that leads to is you and your covenant wailing on the crystal for a long time while killing the infinitely respawning enemies until the crystal eventually dies. For what could have been an amazing, potentially game-making mechanic, it's disappointing.  Probably the most disappointing part is the lack of multiplayer. It could be an amazing game to play with (and against) friends, possibily even enough to make me recommend it, but it's sadly not there.  A perfectly square field of unrealized potential is what Depths of Peril is, and you'll find numerous fields just like it if you choose to play it. While it has unique ideas, ideas alone are not enough for me to recommend buying it over other ARPGs.",-1,1

2048457,236150,Starpoint Gemini 2,"There is a very important tip in this review! If you're going to get this game, you better read on.  I tried to return this game after five hours of trying to make enough money to even by the next better laser in order to break the asteroids faster. And, I can tell you I'm very happy that I passed the hours played deadline for returning it! This really is a quite fun game if you know the right way to make money! If you think you're going to make money trading or mining, you got another thing coming! Forget about anything except capturing enemy ships.  When you go to a space station, on the upper left you can select hiring troops or mercenaries. Hire as many troops as you can, and then go find an enemy ship. Find an enemy ship that has as many or less personnel than the troops you hired. The number of personnel is listed to the right of the 'lock on' information.  Destroy most of the enemies hull, but leave about a quarter. Then from your 'center mouse button' menu select send troops. Over on the right side of your screen a small flag will appear showing your troops are boarding the ship and how many troops are left on both sides. At this point you can click on the green arrow to send extra troops, if you don't send extra troops you will probably lose the battle. If and when you capture the ship, and you must learn how to capture ships, use the tractor lock on in the 'center mouse button' menu. Then head back to a space station and sell it.   In the beginning ships get you about $100 K, maybe a little less. But that beats the $10 K per trip of breaking rocks. Then use that money to buy better lasers, missiles, and systems upgrades. You do not get experience points for capturing ships though.(unless it finishes a mission) Destroying ships gives you experience points. Once you have upgraded your ship as much as you can, then go start doing missions to gain experience points.  Make sure you save at least one of every higher level ship to use as you rank up. If you are good enough at combat, you can capture ships larger and better than yours. Then once you rank up you can start using them instead. I have succeeded capturing ships with one third less personnel on my ship than the enemy ship. I think the worst damage to the enemy ship the less troops you need.  Definitely read the instructions in the upper right ? Icon.  Pros:  It definitely is a well-made galaxy. It's pretty, large, has lots of planets, anomalies, and wormholes. The wormholes can be a little crazy when you're in a battle and one grabs you and sweeps you away!  It has lots of great ships to choose from.  Plenty of different armaments to choose from.  Some armaments work well in some situations and then do not work as well in others.  Lots of side missions to choose from.  The campaign story is really good.  Cons:   Even though it has a good campaign story, the voice acting is some of the worst I've ever heard in most of the characters. It seems like they went around from high school to high school looking for the worst of the drama students they could find to perform the stories.  The mission text portions have obviously been poorly translated. I think it was originally in German. A lot of the stories and side missions are just given to you in text form, and because of the poor translation it can be hard to understand what they are trying to say.  Considering the size of the galaxy they provide, the main campaign was too short. I did tons of side missions, finished the story, and still had half the galaxy unexplored. Since I find no point in just roaming around the galaxy for no particular reason, the rest will remain unexplored.  All in all:  It was totally money well spent! I also got the two extra campaigns which I will now go and play.",1,0

2050956,236390,War Thunder,"For what it's worth, this is probably one of the better flying and shooting games i've played that involve WWI and WWII aircraft. It's fairly realistic, easy to learn, and easy to find a game. The graphics are decent and you can change cloud density and ground texture. This is mainly a multiplayer game, but it does offer some single player missions if you can get into it. That's pretty much where the good stuff ends, though.  Given that it's Free To Play, of course the game starts you out with literally the crappiest planes they have to offer. The planes you see on as the cover art and in the screenshots? Yeah, you can't have those. It wouldn't be so bad if the matches could be ranked. But every time I joined a session, there was always somebody on the other team with a faster fighter plane that takes more hits and can kill you in two shots. Why two shots? Because you're in a ♥♥♥♥ing bi-plane from World War 1 (unless you play USA and why wouldn't you unless you're some kind of commie) and they're in a German Stuka, for example. And no, you can't fly away, because you are slow as hell. So you might as well just crash into the ground and save them the trouble.   Trust me when I say the dogfights that the game hypes you up for aren't as exciting as they could be. It's usually just you being chased or the other way around and going in circles until somebody gets a lucky shot (or crashes) or the 15 other enemy players arrive to gang ♥♥♥♥ you with endless tracers and bullets. And to top it all off, some people in multiplayer matches have come to believe that ramming their plane into yours is a viable strategy, even though they lose their plane in the process. The point is to NOT get shot down while shooting down enemies!  It is unforgiving, and you will start out very slowly. Unless you have the time and patience like some people apparently do to eventually unlock an actual decent plane, I would not recommend this.",-1,0
2051207,236390,War Thunder,"Very good game overall. Graphics &amp; sound is exceptionally well done. FREE to play &amp; indeed it is, but, it is cleverly structured to induce you to go for a premium account perks. Your in-game Experience is used to upgrade your planes &amp; also to purchase new ones, which, this would take forever without the premium bonus. But the Dev's have more than earned it with all the content delivered plus the continual updates to the game. Solid 9/10 rating. Would love to play it more however if you have a flaky internet connection, you WILL suffer the frustration continually of firing at enemy planes with little effect. Using a fast mobile broadband connection fixes the issue but is helluva expensive.",1,1
2051608,236390,War Thunder,"TL;DR: Previously stated Russian bias (by other reviewers) holds true in a game that is plagued by purposefully bad grinding in order to frustrate you into spending money to ease the pain. War Thunder would otherwise knock  Wargaming.net's  IPs out of the park with stunning visuals, complex and deep controls (optional) and a genuine satisfaction for making the perfect shot on an enemy vehicle. If only Gaijin would get their act together.  ------------------------------------------  Compared to other players? I have nothing in the way of hours. I have a general philosophy when it comes to war games like this.  German tanks, U.S./British planes (Mostly U.S.), Japanese ships.  This is mostly due to the fact that these countries tended to excell in these respective categories. You may have noticed that in no instance did I pick the Russians. Why? Because their involvement in the timeperiod(s) generally covered by these wargames was minor at best. They participated mostly on the eastern front, taking up countries that eventually became the U.S.S.R. at its height.  Now, one might argue one way or the other about the Russian involvement, or about my choices with my tech trees, but I'm mostly going on historical involvement in the war. The Germans spent most of the time on the ground, the U.S./Britain in the air, and the Japanese at sea.  What I ultimately desire is historical accuracy. Armor, handling, traverse speed, armament, etc. Gaijin doesn't appear to do that. Like with  Wargaming.net  (WoT, WoWs, WoWp), they favor the Russians. The difference being that Gaijin appears to do so with great fervor. I have a hard time believing that a Russian light tank had better/thicker armor than a German medium tank, but it's in the stats in the game. Maybe I'm wrong.  Another problem is the monetization, mostly due to how one gains experience. Gaijin not only creates a big grind, but they taunt you with convertable experience that you gain boatloads of, but can't actually use unless you use premium currency. Meanwhile, the actual spendable experience gain is miniscule at best, even if you do well in a match, or are the top player on the winning team.  Then, in order to increase the grind further (beyond the point of comfortableness, which is by design, I would guess), you have to research and buy 6 vehicles in the current tier in order to research a vehicle in the next tier. This forces you to not only waste time trying to unlock extra vehicles, but also forces you to waste normal currency to buy them. Result? You waste time, experience, and money to unlock a bunch of vehicles you probably don't even want, or won't ever use. To my knowledge, you can't even sell them to get part of your money back.  When compared to  wargaming.net , it's almost sad.  Wargaming.net  manages to make the grind annoying enough that some people will buy currency to speed it up, but not so annoying that people who don't want to spend money will just give up on it.  Both graphically, and aesthetically, however, War Thunder beats Wargaming hands down. Vehicle handling is far more advanced in War Thunder, and it even gets you to try and check your aim and pick your shots, due to ricochets, penetration, and placement of vehicle interiors (with the tanks) where one well placed shot will wipe a tank out because you managed to blast the whole crew and detonate the munitions.  If Gaijin were to get their act together, make the grind more like WoT, and actually make all of the vehicles historically accurate to all released specifications, then I'd probably jump ship. (Though maybe not, because I'd probably like both.)  Right now, however, unless you are really keen on being patient, and want a fairly advanced battlegame with inaccurate specifications and bad monetization/grinding, I'd recommend any of  Wargaming.net's  games.  If Gaijin does (someday) gets their act together, then I would completely recommend War Thunder. Until then, if then ever comes, which doesn't seem likely, you decide. I'll still be playing though, because I like battlegames in general.",-1,0

2054200,236390,War Thunder,"I placed a summarized version of my review after the full length version.  I can not recommend tthis game since the 1.37 patch. I downloaded this game not long before the patch and for that time it was a very fun game to play, but now since the progression system has gotten MUCH slower and the fact that the payed-for in-game currency, Golden Eagles, has gotten more expensive and decreased in value(just a side note, I never use in-game currency that you have to shove out real cash for in any game but this is still a bad and very greedy decision), the game just doesn't feel all that fun anymore. Because of this, you are almost guaranteed to be stuck with rather sh*tty planes for a pretty long time while the new tiering system(it went from 20 different tiers to just 5) puts you into games where you are often up against far superior or far inferior aircraft and either way it often ends up with a rather boring game since you are either easily killing the weaker aircraft or you are being killed by far superior aircraft(just so you know, I'm all up for a good challenge, but this can be downright ridiculous at times). If you are a new player, you are very likely to end up being stuck with the first tier aircraft for a longer amount of time because of the new progression system and normally if you have a weaker aircraft, it would be smart to attack ground targets rather than enemy aircraft, but to do that your options are bases(bombs are required to do anything), tanks( bombs are required), pillboxes(bombs are required, at least in arcade mode, I've played realistic battles and I can kill them with a couple of passes and several second long bursts with just my MGs) ships, (bombs or torpedoes are required and only one tier 1 plane in the entire game, you also still need to research this plane, can be equipped with torpedoes), mobile AA guns and armored cars(you can kill them with MGs but they are further back and travelling behind the tanks so by the time you reach them, odds are you've already been seen and enemies have realised that you're an easy kill and will reach you soon), or your safest bet which are stationary AA and artillery, usually placed around pillboxes and further up front(you can also kill them with MGs but there are never very many of them and odds are other players, especially ones with lower tier aircraft, are also after them). I've also noticed over time that when you buy, after researching, enhancements to your aircraft and also when buying new aircraft, the amount you need to pay is far less than what you have(a modification might cost 8 or 9 thousand and you have at probably the least, even if you're not very good at the game, about 150 thousand or more than twice that much, like in my case, meaning that the normal in-game currency(Lions) is extremely easy to get and it's all too easy to amass a large surplus of it while research points(what you need to research aircraft and enhencements), on the other hand, are extremely hard to get and it will take forever to amass an amount that you can do anything with.  To summarize my point, the 1.37 patch has: made it nearly impossible to get new planes without spending a very long time on the game(even for someone who does absolutely nothing but play videogames and still lives in their parent's home would need months to unlock all planes from ONE country) keeping you stuck with inferior planes for a good long time, made matches boring, and proven the company that made the game, Gaijin, to be run by a bunch of greedy b*stards who have even managed to somehow ♥♥♥♥ off the gamers who are willing and able to pay for in-game currency even on free-to-play games by increasing the cost of the paid-for in-game currency while also decreasing the value of it.  I still play the game out of sheer boredom sometimes but it usually doesn't keep me occupied for too long. This game had potential, and still does IF Gaijin fixes the problems from the 1.37 patch, but, as it stands right now, this game is basically dead in the water and won't be starting back up again anytime soon, if at all.",-1,0

2059588,236430,DARK SOULS™ II,"You probably won't like this game. You will die, your ego will be crushed, your soul exhausted, and you will inevitably fail at every turn. Yet somehow in those moments when you do succeed, learning from every agonizing death, it is one of the most triumphant feelings in the world. Those heart-pounding moments where you narrowly dodge a towering giant monster's killing blow and swiftly strike at him with your last ounce of stamina, bringing him to his knees and finally overcoming him... are the most rewarding moments you will ever experience in gaming. But to get there, prepare to die. A lot.   About the game :Dark Souls 2, like Dark Souls, is a 3rd person RPG set in a fantasy world filled with nasty beasts that are much more powerful than you. Bosses are even more powerful, and require gaining knowledge through fighting them (and dying a lot). Think MMO raid bosses, except here you're on your own.  The combat is the shining star of the game. Every enemy has their own movement patterns and attacking styles, which turns every enemy into a sparring match and a mental game of chess against the AI (which is impressively brutal). Learning enemy attack patterns is the key to succeeding (bosses included), and boss fights in particular challenge you to try new techniques.  Your stats can be upgraded throughout the game and you will grow stronger. The armor and weapons you find can be upgraded as well in order to customize your character to your fighting style. Want to me a nimble rogue that dual wields daggers? A sorcerer in cloth armor that attacks with spells from a distance? A heavy armored knight with a tower shield and giant axe? You can build your character to be any of these, or any combination of these.  The bottom line is that this isn't a game that anyone can pick up and enjoy. This is an extremely difficult game that is made for patient people who enjoy complex stat systems, experimenting with different play styles, and adapting to the challenges that the game throws at you. If you can handle it, Dark Souls 2 is a masterpiece that should be experienced by anyone who calls themselves a gamer. Getting through it, on the other hand, will test you in ways you haven't been tested before. You have been warned.  Keep Calm and Praise the Sun.",1,1

Bought 7 copies for 5 dollars, and got it to work as soon as i put it in, okay. The loadout is personally my favorite aspect of this game, you get to make your own loadout, to fit your personal standards, cool. But the game, is, TERRIBLE, first off, when you play the training, its basic, you already know how to fit this game, the controls are standard, but serve no purpose. When you play your first mission, you will know what I'm talking about. The AI is too smart, smarter than your highly trained SWAT team you have following you like mindless zombies. When they see a bad-guy, they say Tango Spotted, so I tell them to shoot it, they just look at it though. The enemy AI always knows where you are. Your only intel is what the game gives you. You spend more time getting killed by super buffed pirates than you do killing pirates that aren't trained. If you're going stealthy, you'd expect that they wouldn't know where you are. But really, all they do is aim at you, until you come into the direct line of sight, then they start running after you. Glass is bad for you, because you can't entirely see through it, but the enemy can, and shoot at you, killing you on the first hit. There are around 2-3 people that are programmed to look in a certain direction, and not staring at you the entire time. Your team is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, you cannot tell a single person what to do. You have a sniper, an assault, and a breach, you are supposed to be the recon, but what if you don't like that class? Your team will stare at a bad guy, but not fire. They do not know where a single person is, until the person shoots them in the head, with their 99.99% accuracy, while yours and your teammates accuracy is 80%. Your team is clunky, ending up alerting the enemy before you can scope out the map, because you cannot make them wear different armor, or armor fit for what you want to do. The mission always wants you to go steath, when the mission objectives call for action. Your team always has silencers, when you don't even need them. Now I'm getting started on multiplayer. Half the time, you're on the team with a prick, who only wants you to hate the game you payed for, it's not even free, so they kill you with their insta-kill guns, wearing huge-♥♥♥ armor, so they kill the entire team before the game even really starts, then they kill themselves, because they're bored. Other than that the maps are too big for 6 on 6 team deathmatches. If you could have 12 people on each team, then it would be fair, and the match would be 90% more interesting, but it's full of boring experience. I was lucky to buy the game for less than a dollar, you, are not. If you really want this game, just message me and I'll send you a copy. But be warned, until the makers seriously patch this game.

2065411,236690,Blood Bowl 2,"Bloodbowl's gameplay could be described as a Turnbased, RPG lite with elements from both American Football and Chess. Or as one of the most FRUSTRATING game ever... Until you actually figure out how to play. And this is where I think most people are at when it comes to Bloodbowl. They get a couple of Double skulls, and from there decide that the game is bull****.   And than there are those who would argue that Bloodbowl 2 is not as good as previous Video Game versions. Which in all honesty is accurate. This game is indeed lacking in MANY options that previous games had including extra Online League Options, Singleplayer Campaigns, Races and various Thematic elements such as Racial specific Cheerleaders, differences in armor for higher level players, etc.   However, the reason I am recommending this game is because dispite all of the downsides, it has one very big upside. Graphics.  Now I know many are already thinking 'Graphics don't make games good! Gameplay does!' And while that is most certainly true in many cases, it's a bit like saying that you shouldn't buy a new better looking version of Chess because it's no different. The Gameplay of Chess is NEVER going to change, so in essence if you have the choice between a videogame adaptation that looks like crap vs one that doesn't, which are you going to get?   Now I am in NO way disregarding the fact that the content of this game is not all that great in comparison to older Bloodbowl games, Especially in the Singleplayer experience. What I am saying is that the better graphics do make it a more enjoyable game overall.   Now if you are someone who is interested in getting into Bloodbowl in general this is a very good jumping off point. The UI is clean, very few bugs, and the Graphics are pleasing to the eyes.   Bloodbowl is an amazingly fun Risk Management game and Bloodbowl 2 is a great adaption of it. But keep in mind that buying this game for it's Singleplayer experience is a bad idea. But if you're like me who got it to play with/against friends and Random internet people it is most certainly worth it.",1,0
2066339,236690,Blood Bowl 2,First off the game takes anything good from the first game and removes it. Second the AI cheats a lot in this game. The play will always get terrible dice rolls. While the AI will get good rolls for most of the time.  The teams have some poor balance as well. With the two DLC teams being far better then the standard teams. Making the dlc feel like they are pay to win.  Good luck playing MP. First you have to sign up for a league. Then spend the next few hours hoping someone in the league will want to play. I tried many times to get into an MP game and got bored after 2 hours waiting.  I am hoping someone mades some dice mods so the game is at less playable. As right now it just a waste of money.,-1,0

What was promised as the first game using DirectX 12 is just not working at all with DirectX 12, I got freezes and CTD all the time so I had to go back to DirectX 11 and even then it's still messy. And seriously, how do they dare charging us 12.99€ for a 2 to 3 hours long game ?

2082911,237850,Dreamfall Chapters,"This Game is one of the best Games here on Steam. Now before we start off with the good things let me say that in the beginning I had a horrible stutter for the first 2-3 hours. But one day I restarted the game and it all went away as if it never exist. I don't know why or what changed but I am happy it never went back to awful again.  This Game is introducing you to 3 different Characters and their Stories. I saw that this game is as such a sequel to the previous Games which I haven't played but are here on steam. (The Longest Journey &amp; Dreamfall: The Longest Joruney).  Dreamfall Chapters has an amazing Story which took me 24 hours to complete. It is very atmospheric and I immediatly fell in love with the Characters. The Voice Acting is done very well and the animation is also rather well made.   Unlike the Tell Tale Games it actually does matter which choices you make and therefore has a big replayability factor. So do listen as you won't be able to just skip through.   It is honestly like reading a book but making your own decisions regarding the main characters.  The Last time I was so in love with a Story and its characters was on Final Fantasy XIII.   I can recommend this game to anybody that loves the Tell Tale Games, Life is Strange or any kind of choice game that is as such similiar.   I can also recommend this Game to anybody that has played the previous games before as I think that this one is a must for every Fan.  I can also recommend this Game to anybody that hasn't played the previous games as everything in this game is explained very well.   I can't recommend this game to anbody that isn't into these kinda games.",1,1

2087178,237890,Agarest: Generations of War,"A Turned Base Statergy RPG with Lovely graphics. The Japanese game markers have a talent for working bits of popular genres into a game seemlessly that often leaves you wondering which genre of a game you are actually playing. Agarest is a Turn Based Statergy game with a strong RPG tied into it's game mechanics. It also has story elements from both the epic FRPG genres that they are known for as well as Relationship/Dating sims that we have come to think of as uniguely Japanese at it quirkiest.  All in all, I would recommend this title to anyone that finds themselves like any two of the three genres mentioned above. And If you have only ever enjoyed one of the three, give this game a try, you may find some new genres to enjoy. I plan on getting many of hours of enjoyment out of this title.",1,0
2087526,237890,Agarest: Generations of War,"I Completely Enjoyed playing this game however i wouldn't Recommend it for anyone. as for why i woudn't Recommend it even though i really enjoyed it, LETS START :  If it was just an average RPG with the same story and gimmicks, I would have been happy to give this game an above-average rating. The problem is that the game falls flat on its face when it comes to the actual 'game' part of the game.  I have never seen so much need for an auto-battle feature before in my life. The auto-battle exists (barely), but is so mind-numbingly stupid that you generally have to go a third of the game backwards to find opponents you can auto-grind against, but it's still far superior to having to spend the hundreds of hours it takes to beat the game gaining XP the normal way.  Grinding is excruciating and necessary. On Hard, bosses will kill your characters in one hit, no matter even if you spent every single character point on NOTHING but getting more hit points. (And I did, for every character, because there's little point in anything else.) When they use their super-moves, (which they can do at will,) they often get the 'overkill' bonus for dealing triple the HP of my characters in damage. Survival is a matter of packing max recovery items and spreading out so that only one character dies at a time.  Because every combo you can do has to be not just pre-planned before battle, but pre-equipped and oftentimes grinded for, itself, the theoretically tactical grid-based combat basically always comes down to getting into the exact same formations, using the exact same combos you've metered out exactly to take advantage of the exact amount of AP you can spend. There is nothing in the game to make any one given battle any seriously different from another, besides maybe the bosses, but even every boss starts looking the same after a while. (In fact, at the end, they just outright keep reusing the same boss.) Hence, auto-battling just to keep from drooling boredom. (And because the auto-battle is awful, you have to grind more on auto-battle to survive auto-battling.)  When 'playing' the game usually entails just putting a weight on the button to walk upwards, and then leaving for a while so that auto-battle auto-levels your characters, just so I can do something else while 'playing' the game, it's a problem.  Worst of all, there's basically no way to get the good ending without using a guide, and if you screw up anything (and the game gives you basically no hints as to how you're screwing yourself over, or even where to look,) you have to start the WHOLE GAME OVER TO TRY AGAIN. That's right, 500 hours down the drain. When you DO finally beat the game, the game says, 'Congrats, now onto the TRUE FINAL BOSS, which incidentally, is level 700. What, you're only level 100? Here's a new place to grind forever in, and all your old characters back, back at level 20. No, of course there's no experience sharing. Grind harder, sucker.' I estimate 'beating' this game will take roughly 1,000 hours, and I'm not even exaggerating.  That's roughly where I figured I was just completely not having fun anymore, and abandoned the game for good.  Oh, but as a bonus, they include 'free DLC' that they originally charged people for, which basically includes just plain BUYING exp. Yeah, that's right, their business model was to make a game where you grind forever, and then sell people exp.  In summary, the story and style of the game may or may not be to your taste, but the actual mechanics of the game get downright masochistic. When a game is best played by having a book to read to get you through the boring parts, (read: 99.999% of the game,) then it's not exactly something I can in good conscious recommend to any but the most rabid of JRPG dating-sim fans.",-1,0

2090082,237930,Transistor,"This is the only game I have ever reviewed on steam. And that's because it's this good. Back in the dark times of my piracy days I torrented this game and played through it and stopped after the end credits. And it's not like I didn't want to play again, actually it is one of the few games I ever wanted to play again, and the only one I wanted to start immediately after the first playthrough. The reason I stopped myself was that I knew right away I would buy that game and play through it at least two more times. And now, when my library is getting close to 500 and my days on the Torrent Seas are long past, it still holds true. It is my second favourite game of all time, the first place being held forever by WC III The Frozen Throne on the sole principle that I probably spent more time playing and talking about that game that I spent doing literally anything else. Transistor settled above FF VII, all three Bioshocks, entire Witcher trilogy, Planescape Torment, Dragon Age, Dark Souls and so many others exquisite games. And I can't even properly say why. The game is short, and even though the plot is easy to follow, if you want to get the full story it requires skill grinding. But the gameplay is so good, and said grinding made so much fun by the various ways you can put the skills together, that even I, being allergic to the idea of grinding ever since the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Golden Saucer (I still don't know if Omnislash was worth it...) wasn't bored even for a nanosecond. And, well, the story is so worth it, the picture of Cloudbank painted through the various character profiles fascinated me more than many worlds in other, more straightforward stories. And at the same time it is a complete experience on it's own, which, to be honest, could also be a minus. Those 12+ hours are two playthroughs, but after the first one the story was pretty much complete, only one or two character profiles to finish. There was very little to talk about with my friends. The reason this could be a minus comes from the fact that another game that forces you to look for the full story *ekhmDarkSoulsekhm* comes to mind, and that one resulted in hours of speculations. Still, this is no Dark Souls, and I can't say I feel this lack of ambiguity is a fault on games part. I was really satisfied with how the story unfolds, the resolution of that build-up towards confrontation with Camerata, and the ending. Yes, the ending was at the same time probably my favourite in all fiction I had ever come in contact with, and the reason I nominated this game for 'I'm not crying...' Award. OK, I'm gonna stop myself now, before I write another two pages of a love letter to Supergiant Games for this masterpiece, I probably made myself clear. The gameplay is a surprising and surprisingly well executed mix of action and tactical RPG, the story is great, the 'interactions' between two main characters are brilliant, the game is incredibly fun. Oh yeah, and the 'Great Soundtrack' on those tags is definitely not just for show, but nothing I could write would do it justice. Suffice to say I've been listenin to it on the train for most of the last two years. Damn, it's been two years... If the 'hrs on record' on record is higher than 12,5 I probably replayed that again. And again in some not far future. But seriously, this game is awesome :D",1,0

The overall feel of the game is wonderful and the vocals in the soundtrack hit me right in the feels. However saying that, once you have figured out the optimal function set-up the game becomes repetitive and the more difficult fights can become irritating and repetitive, particularly since you'll often times get almost one shot and have to restart. I think the developers were on to a great combat system but I'd like to see it further developed with more varied enemies and functions. Not a great deal of replayability as I managed to get all the achievements with two playthroughs and there was nothing drawing me back in after that.

2103516,237990,The Banner Saga,"The most important aspect of a game is the combat for me (if it has combat), it makes or breaks the game. Combat mechanics are not very good in the banner saga, mostly the armor damage calculations.   For example my character has 8/9 stats which is attacking an enemy with 10/11 stats. That 9 damage of my character is decreased to 1 when attacking either the enemy's armor or strength. Surely I’m going to lose the fight. Also the damage done to armor does not seem straight forward as I have not figured out the calculation. The wiki says it’s just damage - armor = damage done, but that is not the case in most instances, as other hidden factors are affecting it.   The game starts you off in situations like this and outnumbered in the ones I played, making it pretty frustrating when you are new and learning the mechanics and tactics.   When I lose a fight it seems like nothing really happened. The story keeps going. I wonder if I could go through the whole game speed clicking on dialog and lose every fight without any divergence to the game or loss state.",-1,0

2114428,238210,System Shock 2,"I got interested in SS2 because I am a big fan of the original Deus Ex and have played through that several times. This is no Deus Ex. DX has stealth, conversations, and an engaging story. SS2 seems to be an old-fashioned shooter that may have story elements to it, but I don't have enough peace from being attacked to listen to any of the logs and understand it. About the only similarities I see to DX are the graphics and the fact that they both start out relatively hard -- but SS2 is MUCH more difficult to start than DX. I started at 'normal' but immediately had to reduce to the 'easy' mode and I still die over and over. The narrator says things, but I have no idea what she's talking about. 'Go to Storage Room Blah-Blah and get a Something-or-Other.' The storage room isn't marked well on the map, which requires you to tab out to see and then needs a magnifying glass to read it. If you can see what you want, it's at the far side of a maze and you can't find your way there without constantly re-opening the entire map -- which is usually when you get attacked, so you might as well just roam around and hope you come to the right spot.  You can easily understand the advances in gaming since this game was high tech. There is no tutorial; the map is poorly designed; every alarm you set off brings fresh hordes of attackers; when your inventory is full and you pick up something, the game drops something else for you, which you may not notice; and items on the floor may disappear without notice. Another thing I've noticed is that the guides for this game are written by experts who assume more knowledge than I have.  One thing I'm not complaining about are the graphics or the sound; there are enough mods out there that these are not a problem for me. Just the gameplay. I've had numerous restarts and spent a couple of hours roaming around and trying to figure things out, and it's just not fun, so I'm giving up on it.

Trying to solve a puzzle while a deranged mental patient attacks you whom you can't attack back goes from scary to rather irritating after the 5th time it happens and since this game isn't too long, these encounters feel a little too frequent for them to be unnerving for very long. The game starts to drag in the middle, but does actually pick up a little bit towards the end. At the very least, the game doesn't drag its feet and overstay its welcome such as the first two Dead Space games, only managing to be about 6 or 7 hours depending on how many times you die and whether or not you decide to explore the environments as I did.   Would I recommend? With the intention of not sounding condescending, I would only give this game a play if you're easily scared or don't play these kinds of games very often.

2126157,238320,Outlast,"on the search for a solid horror game, i finally came across outlast. I wanted something with good ambience and not relying simply on jumpscares and this one seemed to fit the bill. its not a super long title, maybe 7 hours on a basic play through, but it will be the scariest hours you spend in a game. from start to finish this game puts you really on edge. I played with the lights off, always at night and with the sound up.  pros -   +scary as hell +decent graphics +good sound +decent stealth gameplay +seriously scary.  +good storyline +freaky setting,  cons -  -short campaign -can get a little repetitive  -may have a heart attack at some point  id give this one a 8/10. solid horror game that will scare you from start to finish without constant jumpscares all the time.",1,0
2126474,238320,Outlast,"My two Outlasts:  Great atmosphere, interesting story based on project MKUltra (a real CIA project back in the 60s), gameplay that is somehow repetitive but the great level design makes it enjoyble.  In few words, a good game that deserves to be played.   BUT: There are few things to say (bad things). First of all, I want to compare this game to Amnesia, because they are pretty similar.  * The mechanic considers not to kill anyone, just run and hide. That's OK, but there is no proper reason to do so. In Amnesia you couldn't kill the foes anyway, here, well, they seem human afterall. At least an explanation why I'm not trying to stab them ( expecially when you see all those knives... and your rage level is over the top for obvious reasons...). 'But the guy is creeped out'. Yes, whatever.  * If you reload your camera, the old battery is gone. So, if you do it by mistake with full energy still in there, you just lost one battery.  * Monsters in Amnesia were more 'creepy', and the fact that you couldn't even see them whitout losing your mind, was pretty cool. Here, well, not so much. In normal difficulty you can just run towards any foe, get hit once, and then run somewhere else searching for an exit (or a checkpoint). * Speaking about checkpoints, do you know that you can recharge a battery simply 'save &amp; exit' and than reloading? Maybe this is cheating, but knowing that you have this possibility lets you play not caring so much about wasting batteries.  * In the end... is not so scary. The game is fun to play, can give you some chills, jumb scares, so on, but in the end is pretty linear, and the gameplay is 'foolable' enough to get used to almost every scary aspects of the game.   Real value of the game: 10$",1,0
2127076,238320,Outlast,"This is one of the scariest games I've played, easy. Silent hill, Amnesia have new competition and its glorious. Enter Mount Massive Asylum. The heavy doors shut behind you and the encroaching darkness and haunting screams are your only company. That is, besides the inmates themselves. Armed with nothing but a camcorder's nightvision for sight you navigate the haunted house of healing bravely venturing with shivered breath, hoping for any way out of the madness. 'death is falling farther down the list of the worst things that could happen to me, here'  THAT IS....until the last hour of gameplay. Im really sad to say that the fear-engine does not last forever and sputters to a crawl when you suddenly find yourself in a COMPLETELY NON HORROR (here meaning incredibly well lit, non-sequiter in design and VERY sparsly populated- even for this kind of horror) SETTING fighting against ghosts controlled by a comatose dude in a bathtub.  By far the scariest part of this game are the TWINS. Unfortunately they too fall victim to the blindsiding derailing of any tension and atmosphere brought about by the end of the tale.  It started out incredibly(!) strong but late-game dissappointments stacked up fast and HARD. No spoilers, but it ends on a downer. Which Id be fine with if it wasnt for the plummeting storyline that came before it.  Its like the storyline was a ceiling that held firm and then collapsed directly on the protagonist. Thats the best metaphor I can come up with without spoilers  + Great atmosphere. Creaky floorboards, haunting screams, subtle music cues coupled with unrelenting 'eeeeEEEEEEEEEE' horror score (you know what I mean) Jump scares are few but used effectively  + Camcorder for note-keeping and nightvision. Daring and innovative mechanic to match the modern setting/tech and forces you to keep your eyes on the awaiting horror lurking in the dark  + STRONG antagonist characters (with 2 exceptions IMO) A mad priest with dubious alliegance to helping you. A brutish horror bent on dragging the whole building down around you just to taste your flesh. A psychotic, yet sociable, witch-doctor obsessed with surgery/disection and exhibitionism. Worst of all: The Twins. Two perma-nude brothers hell bent on making you into a human-pinata and collecting their 'prizes'  +/- the notekeeping and documents. This is more for the characters notes made during the game. Very very well written and personal and really keep you involved with the protagonists feelings on whats around him. The problem is you HAVE TO have your cam running to get the notes which is a shame because they're really fun to read but if you miss them- they're gone forever. Same with the docs  - Story completely derails in the last hour bringing with it inappropriate and tension-ruining sci-fi elements, government conspiracies and Mr House from Fallout NV  - Batteries for your camcorder run out REALLY fast with N/V on. Batteries fortunately arent that few or far between but the disconnect between how long you have without NV and when its on is... just a *little* too big. This is a minus because in most sections if you arent using N/V you literally wont be able to see ANYTHING which directly relates to....  - Sometimes it can be really confusing as to what you're supposed to do/go. You usually have a vague 'turn on power to ____' goal but not always. The absence of a map makes this one you'll need to play quick otherwise you'll get lost really fast- and not in a good way. Winding paths and doors/paths being blocked behind you mean if you arent careful you'll end up missing collectibles with no way to go back  Grade: B- It sucks that I have to knock it down. This game would be a solid A if it wasnt for the incredibly bizarre non-sequiter ending sequences. Also the 'deaths' of certain antagonists leaves a lot to be desired  (Caution: LOTS of male nudity in this game)",1,0
2128506,238320,Outlast,"I enjoyed this game, it's well made and delivers highs and lows, just to what could be expected. It relies on jump scares, though the atmosphere is great, it can be predictable at times. The second time won't be as scary, as it is - a 'one playthrough game'. I don't want to spoil anything but the ending is one of the most scariest levels I've ever played. So my hats off for the fantastic moments Outlast, I hope these guys will make another horror game in the soon...near future :)",1,0
2131112,238320,Outlast,"OVERALL - 7.5/10  Ultimately, I was very satisfied with this game. It was supposed to be a game that scares the ever living ♥♥♥♥ out of you, and it does that exceedingly well. In the moment I am able to get past a lot of the flaws, but given time to reflect on the game, the issues become a little more obvious. What Red Barrels has done, however, is create a game that really sits in my mind long after I have put the controller down, even to the point that this is the first game I thought of reviewing on Violent Color long after the games release. This is also one of the only games I really pressured my close friends into playing, as one of those 'Holy ♥♥♥♥, you have to play this!' kind of things. These experiments were quite often failures for those that were too afraid to play, so I can't really say this is a game that will draw in people who aren't fans of the survival horror genre.

2131191,238320,Outlast,"WAITING FOR OUTLAST 2 !!! *-*   As one of the most popular horror games in the huge gamer society, it utterly connects you to the atmosphere. I totally recommend people to play it with headphones -especially with the isolated ones- and at night to feel the action. Graphics are perfect and easy to play. The point is being able to come up with a working strategy while solving the mysterious hospital case. Also i strongly believe that the reader notes and the ones you find in the game are pretty important. Not for the process in the game just for making it more real. If you have doubts about buying just trust me and continue! Don't let the rewievs or scary spoilers discourage you.    Enjoy!",1,0
2132489,238370,Magicka 2,"Magicka 2 makes me feel... Betrayed. Kind of. Changes are questionable at best.   Humour...  A bit more agressive. Not offensive, agressive. First magicka was like a shy, clunky but funny wizard, who isn't takes himself too serious. By the times of the sequel he bought a red nose, bright stupid robe and megaphone and roams the streets, screaming 'LOOK I'MA CLUMSY WIZARD! LAUGH!' Point: Most of jokes there have no point.  Okay, maybe this one isn't correct, and first game was just as screaming 'I'M FUNNY', and it's my nostalgic-o-filter removed any bad memories. Soo, this part will be in the final score, but have no influence on it.   Magic system changes...  Huge nerf hit the best steam-shock-arcane and ice-earth combos. R.I.P. my only usable lategame/DLC spells. Basic wind attack are magicka now. Also, cooldowns for everything. EVERYTHING. They put a high priority in nerfs. Are we playing serious PvE MOBA now? ..wait, aren't those two terms mutually exclusive?.. Point: Unnecessary, even stupid changes.   Difficulty...   I was unable to pass trough a some point where you should spin a water wheel. Why? I was alone. Enemies keep spawning endlessly, and water wheel needs to be constantly showered for... For at least 15 seconds, I guess. More than enough for crabs to butcher a player. Point: Simply unplayable at singleplayer. Like at all.  Looks like that part with water wheel got changed a bit, with flow of crabs replaced by a few scripted bunches. That point will be rewritten after I make it to the end. Still, no one of my friends wants to buy it now.    Interface and controls...   My god.  Warning: lots of bunnies ahead. First. What the bunny is this? Hotbar? It's just... Wrong. Magicka is a game about pure button mashing, with disadvantage of high error chance being an important part of the first game. It's like for a fighting game devs to include hotkeys for instant combo attacks. Second. What the bunny is wrong with this camera? At the moment battle beguns it moves to the monsters, basically instantly cornering player with enemies all over the screen. That's bunny beautiful. Third. What is this, strafing? Okay, where is my covers, regeneration, machinegun and first-person view? Games where attack (shot) happens when you press mouse button may need strafing.  Games where attack (boulder throw) happens after you release mouse button should NOT have strafing. It's bunny annoying to aim. Fourth. Loading screens. Menus. Tips. Ahem. Are you... Wait a second. Ahem. ARE YOU   BUNNY KIDDING ME?! IF DEVELOPERS ARE TO BUNNY LAZY TO SIT TEN MINUTES IN A BUNNY IMAGE EDITOR AND MAKE A TWO BUNNY SEPARATE 'Press X to continue' IMAGES FOR PC AND CONSOLE, THEY SHOULD ALREADY CONSIDER FINDING A NEW BUNNY JOB. Mostly because such laziness shows how much they care about what are they doing. It's literally twenty minutes of work at worst, and it pokes in the eyes of every player from every bunny loading screen! Okay, maybe it was due to some technical limitations. Then I'm sorry. BUT IT ISN'T BUNNY 80s, AND WE AREN'T PLAYING 8-bit CONSOLE GAMES  , ARE WE? Point: Embarrassing. Ugly status effects. Annoying strafing. And I don't want to know what button I should press on gamepad my PC don't have.   Graphics...  Okay, spells looks cooler than in first game. But they are just taken from Magicka: WW, aren't they? Point: Better than in first game, same as in MWW. Nothing looks improved.  Final scores:       Element   Effect        Humour    Vlad/10        Magic changes    Nerf/10        Difficulty    Alone/10        Interface and controls    Bunny/10        Graphics    MWW/10        Combination of those 5 elements?

Working together, hunting, being hunted, extractions etc. As small of a thing as it was, I thought the cellphone idea was cool. Overall, I would not pay anything for this game if it receives no major updates.   The controls are very clunky. Granted, this is partially due to my machine, but I found the gameplay very rough when the action was on. Graphics-wise, I was not super disappointed (because I paid nothing) but given what is out there I would expect more. Gameplay was only fun because I played with others. Oddly enough, I agreed with another player who said the running around searching for a way out and looking for ammo/tools was probably more like a 'real' zombie apocalypse than running and gunning everywhere. Playing as a zombie was basically like Left 4 Dead but worse. I would have preferred dying and waiting for my teammates to die or win instead of playing as a zombie OP.

Splitscreen means that I can select a local co-op mode and play with my friends from my couch. Splitscreen DOES NOT MEAN IT IS A NIGHTMARE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO START A 2-PLAYER GAME AND THEN AFTER THE NIGHTMARE IS OVER ANOTHER NIGHTMARE BEGINS WHERE THE CONTROLLERS WORK BUT EACH PLAYER ONLY HAS HALF THE CONTROLS. This kind of ripoff happens too often on here. 'Oh, the game is splitscreen. Oh...nvm mind. It's just another nightmare.' Cannot recommend.

2150868,238750,Might & Magic X - Legacy ,"After putting 80+ hours into this game with two ongoing playthroughs I definitely recommend Might and Magic X: Legacy. At first I was slow to succumb to its charms. I felt the controls and immersion were a little clumsy, the voices and sound effects cheesy at best, and the visuals less than stellar. When I got to the heart of the game, however, all of those things faded to the background and I found a lot to enjoy in the party building, monster smashing, and exploration. I encourage newcomers to begin with an open mind and to be prepared to invest some solid time with a trial party to get acquainted with the mechanics and to learn what works well and what doesn't. Then once you have a vision and some goals it makes the challenges in front of you - and your progress - much more rewarding and motivating.  I'm enjoying mysecond playthrough even more, this time using my knowledge of trainer and gear availability, what works best in combat and what doesn't, and an understanding of the pacing of the game to make a challenging party that beats the odds. What's more, the game is deliberately set up to prevent you from trying all of the skills and classes in one go. At first this frustrated me; now I appreciate the built-in replay. A tip on that note: Don't try to do it all, do just a few things really well, and then try a different mix in another playthrough.",1,0

2157789,238960,Path of Exile,"Path of Exile makes a lot of really clever changes to the ARPG/loot collection genre without losing what makes the genre addictive. Any piece of gear can be modified and changed into something useful by using common consumables you pick up, so you never really run into a loot 'dry spell' that prevents you from continuing onwards with the build you are trying to do. Skills granted by gems that are placed into sockets on items, so any 'character class' can use almost any skill as long as they have the stat requirements for it: if you want your rogue-like character to be able to use corpse explosion, he can. Skill gems can also be modified by support gems if you equip them to a piece of gear with connected sockets, so you can make your Corpse Explosion cause enemies to Flee or restore Health when you use it, etc..  Zones are highly randomized with layouts and monsters which keeps the game from getting stale each time you play it or start a new character. Lastly, the developers run timed 'leagues' frequently which encourage you to keep rolling new characters and trying new things to participate.

2174614,239030,"Papers, Please","Few jobs are more soul-sucking than sitting at a cramped desk and shuffling paperwork for hours on end. Now imagine doing that in an Eastern Bloc country during the height of the Cold War, with low pay, bleak conditions and the constant threat of being fired - or worse - if you screw up. Tedious, boring and stressful. Ideal subject matter for a video game, no? And yet Papers, Please is an unforgettable experience. It's been dubbed a 'paperwork simulator' - and that's not entirely inaccurate - but it's truly a game about freedom, power and how fleeting and illusory each can be.  An independent game designed by former Naughty Dog programmer Lucas Pope Papers, Please casts players as a border checkpoint officer in the fictional communist country of Arstotzka. Your job is simple, at least in concept: examine the documents of people who are trying to get into the country, and determine whether they're eligible for entry or should be turned away.  At first it's as easy as checking criteria like passport expiry dates, and rejecting paperwork that's invalid or forged. But before long, Papers, Please becomes a tension-filled juggling act, as you're cross-referencing work permits with identity cards, making sure the applicant's weight matches the value on their entry papers, checking fingerprint records and sometimes doing full-body scans for drugs and weapons.  Every new day adds new rules to follow and new layers of complexity, from making sure applicants' vaccinations are up to date to applying a draconian extra level of inspection for citizens of a rival nation. And every time you let mess up, you lose the money you'd have earned for properly processing that batch of paperwork.  To give the game a sense of grim consequence, your wages are tallied up at the end of each day, from which you must pay for rent, food, heat and medicine for your family. There's almost never enough money for everything... do you let your family go hungry in order to keep the heat on? When both your wife and son are sick and you can only afford medicine for one, who gets it? Despite the retro-flavoured visuals, the act of shuffling virtual papers is actually surprisingly tactile, and spotting a discrepancy and slamming the 'denied' stamp down on a person's passport imparts an odd thrill of power.  But not all decisions are clear-cut, and the game has 20 different endings depending on how things unfold. Do you let a man's pleading wife into the country, even though her paperwork isn't valid and the money it will cost you may mean you can't feed your family that night? Do you deny passage to the man who you suspect is a human trafficker, even though all his documents are in order? Who is behind the enigmatic organization that wants to overthrow the government, and do you dare get involved with their cause?  With a deluge of big-budget, high-profile games on the horizon, it might be easy to overlook a quiet, unusual game like Papers, Please. But don't do that, comrade. The consequences would be dire.",1,1

2188828,239070,Hammerwatch,"I'll start with my veredict on this game: despite being addictive, it's not a well made game.   The gameplay: what most annoyed me in this game was that the designers didn't care a bit about explaining important things to players - the first example that comes to my head are potions: you found an yellow potion? that's cool, bro! now Alt+Tab and GOOGLE it 'yellow potion hammerwatch'. That adds to the amateur aura the game has because of its graphics (see below).   The gameplay(2): I don't think a game necessarily has to have a history, it actually annoys me. But Hammerwatch just drops you on a dungeon without a single word! It's just like that: this is you and this is your dungeon. Now walk and fight. It's pretty odd.  The graphics: they certainly made the increasingly commom mistake - they mistake retro visual style with ugly graphics. The colors haven't been well chosen, the sprites of the scenarios aren't attractive at all. Comparing this game's graphics with, for example, 8-bit-like-graphics Retro City Rampage puts this one to shame.  The audio: the soundtrack isn't really bad, but they could have come up with more tracks, because the loops make the current ones annoying.  The enemies: I remember playing Castlevania - Symphony of the Night and having to fight over 300 different kinds of foes. Meanwhile, in Hammerwatch, they didn't really feel like designing more than 5 different enemies for a game you take a few hours to complete. 'Oh, you think we should have made different foes? Well, let's just give some of the existing ones a new color and more speed and health'  Co-op: You played for 2 hours with friends but you would like to change your class? FORGET IT! i mean: what's this guys' problem? Why can't i start with another character and no upgrades at all? One of your friends has to leave and you and your remaining 2 friends wanna carry on playing? FORGET IT! start again just the 3 of you.

2190234,239140,Dying Light,"Dying Light is a mostly fun zombie-slaying game that utilizes parkour. It's brought to you by the creators of the first Dead Island and Dead Island: Riptide, Techland. Dying Light outshines Dead Island greatly, even with its launch issues. It features better writing, a greater sense of verticality that works well with the parkour and grappling hook, skill trees that make progression feel more significant, graphic and enjoyable combat, a fearsome night, some bugs, and questionable design decisions that did not sit well with me.   The story has one main protagonist instead of a cast of four a la Dead Island. You play as Kyle Crane, an undercover GRE (Global Relief Effort) agent sent to recover a file lost within the city of Harran. As Crane, you bear witness to the insane brutality and sadness that affect the survivors of the devastated city. Dying Light managed to present an okay, passable story that did not make my eyes glaze over as if I were one of the undead. The main antagonist was crafted to be obviously evil and fond of diabolical plans which came off as cheesy or cliché at times. The writing lacked the finesse to not be predictable. However, some of the side-quests were very well done with how they portrayed loss and grief. On the other hand, the game definitely could have done without the useless find x number of item side quests that served no purpose or told any stories.   Dying Light's world is generally fun to navigate due to the winning mixture of parkour and well used vertical space. Although, sometimes you will find yourself falling down and taking damage due to learning what can and cannot be grabbed, a feeling that's amplified with the use of the grappling hook. You will need to learn how to use its lock-on on ledges before channeling Just Cause's Rico Rodriguez since you can grapple onto most surfaces, including the ground. Unfortunately, Kyle Crane cannot use the grappling hook on zombies. The parkour keeps on improving as you level up the Agility tree and chain maneuvers. Do you want to vault off a zombie and dropkick another zombie into spikes or vault off a railing to drop two stories below, avoid damage by rolling, and then continue to run about? It feels like Mirror's Edge's lite with its own style, but no wall running.   The world of Dying Light uses height well. The first major area in the game is in a poorer part of Harran filled with shops, abandoned vehicles, cheap housing, incomplete skyscrapers, a large highway, a sweet bridge, radio towers, a coast, and open areas to run across. The second major area is dense with buildings which plays very well with the grappling hook and jumping around in general. I greatly enjoyed hopping between two story lampposts to cross a plaza or scrambling up buildings to avoid Volatiles during night. Yes, there are radio towers, but during those sequences I thought the game produced a nice sense of height as wind sounds and camera tilting worked to make me nervous. I think only three of them are part of the critical path for the story, so do not worry.   They did a good job with making the points in the skill trees feel significant. There are very few skills that have mundane percentage increases and focus more on adding more to the gameplay via new techniques or recipes. You can end up with throwing stars that can freeze zombies, a spinning attack, an upgraded slide to break knees, or the ability to squash the heads of enemies frolicking on the ground. Skill points greatly affect the way you move, fight, and items you can craft.   The combat has a slow start, but turns into a slaughterfest as strikes start cleaving enemies into two, horizontally and vertically. They could have balanced it better to make the beginning more impactful and prevent the p. I found a great amount of joy in using advanced abilities to destroy hordes of zombies and pesky humans. The humans tend to be much more dangerous when engaging them in melee, especially early in the game. However, you can easily dispatch them with molotovs or grenades if you do not have a firearm handy. I popped heads like watermelons, drop kicked zombies into various environmental hazards, lured enemies into traps, and much more. There should be enough gore in Dying Light for the zombie enthusiast. The zombies come with a bit of variety too. You have normal zombies (Biters), Virals (the runners), Goons, Volatiles (the scary ones), Toads, Bombers, Demolishers, Screamers, hazmat Biters with explosive gas tanks on their back, and Night Hunters if you allow pvp. You will not be killing Volatiles in the beginning. They have multiple attacks and need to be weakened before attacking them. Co-op makes them less scary once your group has decent weapons and support items available, but carelessness will still result death. Co-op is a fun and silly experience with occasional desync hiccups that result in weird physics on bodies.   The night in Dying Light creates an unfriendly environment filled with tension. The night makes zombies more aggressive, allows Volatiles to come out of their nests, and introduces a four level alert system. The more trouble you cause, the higher the alert level becomes causing many angry zombies to converge on your position. I would recommend carefully killing some regular zombies during the night because experience for both Agility and Power are doubled with a bonus to Survivor level as night ends. Co-op tends to trivialize the night experience if everyone is packing flares unless it is a level four alert. The grappling hook also makes night easier until you miss the ledge of a three story building during a chase. God help you if that happens.   This game had some issues upon release with many of them resolved. They are still working on additional issues. You can read through this thread to see a comprehensive list of different bugs:  http://steamcommunity.com/app/239140/discussions/0/604941528488544773/  I personally experienced four bugs: a waypoint that wouldn't disappear from the map, a ledge on an optional radio tower that sent me out of bounds (I could swim back in), being unable to interact after killing enemies with a gun and then switching weapons (patched), and the inability to reach max Survivor level. Not bad with a system that did not meet minimum specs except for RAM.   There were some design choices that did not do the game justice here. The sound design for the guns felt flaccid because they fired as if they all had suppressors. Then the game had a few, annoying deaths that made me bitter. They tend to happen in this manner: you go into a room and a Bomber bursts through a door and kills you instantly or you open a door and are greeted by a Bomber or two. At one point in the game, they change the behavior of a hazmat zombie so that it runs toward you and detonates. That kind of design adds nothing to the gameplay or enjoyment of the game. Co-op can help mitigate those situations, but not always. Thankfully, the number of those incidents remains below ten. The game make use of too many camera effects with the long lasting water effect that blurs your screen for far too long irking me the most. There are no options available to turn those effects off. At this time, you will need to mod them out and a good place to start is  http://www.nexusmods.com/dyinglight/  I know some people do not like those obnoxious effects or film grain. Weapon variety suffers from blunt weapons leaving the weapon pool at higher Survivor levels. Finally, the ending was mechanically disappointing and completely out of place.   Dying Light is not a perfect game. It has its flaws, but it is much, much better than Dead Island and is much closer to achieving that wonderful zombie slaying game I have always wanted. The improved movement adds so much to the game when it comes to combat and navigation. The drop kicks are fantastic.",1,0

They are charging way too much for the game, they hardly did anything to their Dead Island engine that they may as well have called this dead island 4 or whatever ridiculous number they're on. The story is so weak the only reason you will play is to hang out with a friend for co-op. That's what I did... the intro and the ending can not be co-op... I don't know why, it seems like the developers have a problem with co-op and they don't think the whole game should be played together.   I don't know why games are so clueless when it comes to co-op, but they really dropped the ball on this one. It's not finished, or should I say they just don't seem to care about their own game? I would stab myself in the eyes if I had to play this solo... I can't recommend this game for anyone unless it's about 10$ and you have a friend who is bored enough to pay 10$ as well.  Climbing buildings sucks bad, good luck doing it consistently. Once you get the grappling hook, if you can stand the game that long, it's a little more tolerable but even that barely works right.   Shooting guns is a chore, I doubt anyone would bother.   Weapons just break... I don't really care about realism in games as long as it follows the rules of the world, but a crowbar breaking? Kind of hard to believe even though every weapon in the game breaks. I mean I realize this is how china makes things for the USA, but I didn't expect it to be in dying light. What's the point?? All it does is annoy you as a gamer.   Practically non-existent story, if anyone actually follows this crap I feel sorry for them. Dialogue is probably written by teenagers, just tacky, boring. It's a simple over used plot in the zombie universe. I would expect more from 'artists' but certainly feels like a cash grab.   Thoughtless skill tree, and why is there a skill tree anyway? What lame ♥♥♥ purpose does it serve? Just to find out the abilities you could have had at the start would have made the game so much more interesting from the get go, instead they barely even plan it out so you're max at the end of the game. You can unlock every single ability, so why have a dumb skill tree? Makes no sense. Maybe if they made the abilities available, except you just get better at them as the game goes on, but no... I don't expect anything new and different from developers.   The game is overall boring and weak, there is no emotion, no thought... it could have been so much more and they just don't care, and they didn't even improve on the Dead Island series.

There are also (rarely) problems with guards not doing what they should, so you can't ghost some parts or chapters of the game 100%.

Also, one piece of loot and 9 documents are missing from the game, and one of the ingame 'thieving objectives' can't be done, simply because the developers missed to include it in the game. There are also some irritating problems with overlapping and desynced dialog.  The story itself is apparently a mixed bag for some. At first, I disliked the 'emo' female character Erin (a victim in too many ways), but now I can certainly like some aspects of her and feel bad for what happened to her (I don't want to spoil it). The music is good and the atmosphere and graphics is better in this game than in any other I have played. Ever.  You can play the game in three different ways: like a true, careful thief with a stealth approach, use the environment to take alternate paths or as a distraction, and to some extent you can just kill your enemies. But it isn't one of those other games where you are always free to get away with being an assassin. You also get a lot of side missions in the game that are often fun and stimulating and you can play challenge maps to earn a good score on the leaderboard. DLC's include an additional (but bad and boring!) challenge map, three (IMO) helpful booster packs and a must-buy: 'The Bank Heist'. Good to quickly get extra gold, but maybe a little too short to stand on its own as something spectacular other than just one of the 'client jobs'.  Overall, I definitely recommend this game. I'm buying it for the third time! (because I'm a nerd who likes to unlock all the achievements again). It seems there are some loud mouthed haters of this game (who can't even accept positive reviews and the fact that a lot of people DO like Thief). So instead of trying to mature and tolerate that people are into different things, they spend their time on spreading hate and lies about the game, and basically telling people they are losers if they like Thief. In any way, I aim to be objective with this review, but I'm a fan of Thief regardless. I'm not a fan of Internet bullies though.  My recommendation is to really try the game out and take it for what it is. Don't compare it to anything else. Just enjoy it! I also highly suggest playing this on PC, because the game looks better and the controls work much better too, on PC than on console and with a controller. It's my strict opinion that Thief is and remains a PC game and porting it doesn't do it justice, even if it's good that as many as possible can play it of course. Even if you don't have a PC (or not a good enough PC to meet the requirements), you should get your own copy of this game. And get immersed, spend some time and patience on it, because that's what it takes! Again, I have played this game for so long, but then I also have the world record time for completing the game on the highest difficulty settings. So called Custom Master. You have a lot of room to develop as a gamer with Thief, being able to build up your skills, patience and confidence. Sorry for sounding like a bad salesman. I mostly just hope you make the right decision for yourself and have fun! :)",1,0

2207945,239160,Thief,"My apologies, this is gonna be long. But Thief: The Dark Project was one of the VERY FIRST PC games that I ever played, and is one of my favorite games of all times, so I have strong feelings about this...  First off, this game would have worked sooo much better if they had simply called it a reboot of the franchise rather than a sequel. The iconic factions of the setting have disappeared or been swept away, and there's little mention of Garrett's past adventures - frankly, it works much better if I imagine it takes places centuries after the other games and the protagonist is some other Garrett that has taken on the mantle of Master Thief.  That said, the core gameplay is intact (particularly if you play at 'Master' level, as I did) - hiding in the shadows; sneaking up and blackjacking unsuspecting guards; putting out torches with your water arrows and getting into hard-to-reach areas with your rope arrows; looking for alternate pathways through heavily guarded areas; throwing bottles as distractions to get past tight patrols; ever vigilant for valuable loot as well as dangerous traps - it's all there. Lockpicking and 'feeling' for hidden buttons to open secret doors and hidden compartments are all fun minigames, although having to pry open windows FROM THE INSIDE is really silly. The Focus addition is okay, though I didn't use it except for spotting traps. I loved Garrett's 'exhibit' in his home where he shows off all the pretty loot he's stolen; I always figured he had something like that. The mission level design is pretty good - a few chokepoints, but plenty of freedom to find your own path in between.  Unfortunately, there's a lot of little things that detract from the game. The looped dialogue is utterly atrocious - boring and repetitive and annoying. The Moira Asylum level TRIES to be the successor to Bonehoard and Shalebridge, but it's clearly trying too hard and is nowhere near as terrifying or immersive. Exploring the city (and the sidejobs) is great at first, but after a while I couldn't help wishing for a fast travel option. The main storyline is ok... but the ending is rushed and emotionally flat, and it leaves you with little sense of satisfaction or accomplishment.  I have very mixed feelings about this game. I really think if they had spent some more time ironing out its problems, it had the potential to be truly awesome. As it is, while the core of it is good and I had a blast playing it, it has too many drawbacks holding it back from greatness.",1,0
2208325,239160,Thief,"Wow. This game was made by the same people who made Deus Ex: Human Revolution? Or at least some of them?!  This does just about everything wrong. But chief among all is the level design. You thought they couldn't possibly make an open world environment worse than the one in Deadly Shadows? Well, prepare to have your mind blown. This takes the cake as one of the worst environments I have ever played in- and they expect you to run through it, like 20 times if you want to do any side content.  The missions themselves are not all that bad. But most of them are linear as hell. Comparing this to Dishonored.. well, don't do it. I could go on and on about the forced escape sequence after almost EVERY level, the stupid first person stealing animation that takes way too long. The way you have to look through every drawer of a cupboard (well, you don't HAVE to). This game feels like it was designed by 3 completely different teams and then at the end, somebody just took all their half finished work and threw it together.  What a waste of everybody's time. Hey, at least the graphics are pretty, eh?",-1,0
2208347,239160,Thief,"While Thief 1 &amp; 2 are prime examples of outstanding late-90's game design, Thi4f may very well be one of the genres, and certainly the series, darkest and most stupid moments. Eidos Montreal did so many mistakes in this game, both fans of the predecessors as well as new gamers are absolutely right to shun it. Why do I have to QTE so many windows and wooden bars, which look all the same? Why can't I jump, save, hit and act how and when I want to? Why must Garrett, Basso and all the other beloved characters of the franchise be either idiots or absent? Where are Garrett's trusty Sword and Blackjack? When did Looking Glass' grim and authentic world get replaced by some generic, soulless medieval-steampunk hodgepodge? Why are the story, dialogues and documents so shallow-brained? Why is the sound engine so bad? Why does the game look so medicore? Why are the Levels so small, linear and uninspired? And why does a master thief wear makeup? I can only recommend this game at a low price to witness the pure underachievement Eidos created here. Looking Glass' and Ion Storms games were certainly not perfect and they left a lot of room for improvements, but this one is simply an insult. I'd rather play 'Shipping... and Receiving' for a full 20 hours than 20 minutes of this crap. Still I'm going to finish the game, because I love the series so much and somewhere deep inside, there lies the nucleus of a good stealth game. But it barely shines through. I really hope someone makes a remake of T2 in the Dark Mod.",-1,0
2208529,239160,Thief,"Not a great game. It gives you the illusion of 'open world' but it couldn't be more of a lie. There is basically one way to get through each level.

2209318,239160,Thief,"First of all, I haven't played the older games much. What appealed to me was rather the idea of being a thief, sneaking on people and pickpocketing. The graphics further made me want to play this game so I bought it on a sale and started playing.  The gameplay mechanics, in my opinion, were executed well, but I actually had more fun slaughtering guards and shooting them from afar than sneaking behind them and stealing their goods. I don't have a single chapter completed with 'Ghost', in the end everyone got an arrow in their knee. One of the things I liked more was the variety of arrows the sellers provided, ranging from Water Arrows used to put out torches so you can hide easier in the shadows, to the Fire and Explosive Arrows that can light up a guard's body. The focus ability I found very useful in my playthrough, and I always had at least 1 of these flowers that replenished it when you use it all.  The story was actually nothing special, and I didn't actually play because of it. In a point of the game, it actually became rather boring.  All good, but the game is terribly optimized, since the 1st chapter I constantly had bugs, glitches and all kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, the worst part is that many people have experienced the same bugs. I haven't even finished the game and I don't even want to play ever again, the most devastating thing being that my saves got all corrupted and deleted right in the final event of the final chapter. This, and much more had led me to not recommend this game, because if I wanted only the gameplay of Thief, I could have played the older, superior games.  4.5/10",-1,1

2210723,239200,Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs,"I wish Steam had a another option for recommendation that is in between yes and no because Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is neither a good horror game or a bad one. If you're interested in this title it's probably because you played Amnesia: The Dark Descent and were really hoping for a proper sequel, but sadly A Machine for Pigs by comparison is inferior in every way. The world doesn't have that same sense of despair, the monsters are a lot less scary even to look at, infact I want to know how some are a threat because some of them are smaller than you? The story leaves a lot to be desired and it started to lose me a little past the halfway point. The game has had many featers striped away including interaction with enviorment the like rummaging through the drawers and closets, So a sense of exploration is removed. The sanity meter was removed so you can look at the monsters and have that sense of horror removed because you can visually study the creators. The only thing this game does right is it sets a the atmosphere properly with its environments but thats about all it does. I really tried to look at this game for its own merits and not compare it to much to its predecessor, but its rather unavoidable. Even if I did A Machine for Pigs is just simply a short and basic indie survival horror game played once then abandoned. I understand this game was developed by The Chinese Room and that would explain the lack of content because The Chinese Room are known for making experiences more than games. ",-1,0

2211058,239200,Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs,"Booooooring! That is all I can say about this 'horror' title. For the first hour you are teased with a monster but it's basically a walking simulator for the first hour +. You are chasing you phantom children as they dissapear when you vear around the corner. Typical coding mechanics for a video game. Been done hundreds of times before. Moving on...  I never played the first Amnesia. Well that's not true, I played the demo a few years ago. That game was MUCH scarier. Simply because you had a limited light source. In a machine for pigs, your lamp never runs out and you can run for an eternity, never getting tired. The controls are passable as are the graphics. Nothing next gen here.  In conclusion, just play the first Amnesia. This game isn't scary, only boring. If you are having trouble sleeping, play the first hour of the game.",-1,0
2211158,239200,Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs,"This isn't a bad game, except for it's mechanics.

(YOU CAN'T PICK UP ANYTHING). The story is not terrible, but is poorly understood throughout most of the game, and personally I expected the sequal to be about either Daniel returning to the ruins of Castle Brennenburg or playing as Daniel's son left alone after Daniel suffered from (Amnesia maybe?) some type of disease, but this was truly dissapointing.",-1,0

The story is complete nonsense, all I managed to gather was that you are dracula and you must stop Satan because of reasons. They pretty much removed all the clever platforming and normal puzzles that the first lords of shadow had. There is a new pointless stealth system that was poorly executed.

I'm not strictly against 'iterative' games where frequent deaths are part of the game. I enjoy the constant 'iterative' deaths in Super Meat Boy, for example. But at least in Super Meat Boy, when I die, I don't feel like I was robbed. Spelunky feels like the gameplay equivalent of a mugging. If that's what you like, then by all means, this is the game for you. As for me, I've tried to like it and I just can't.

2217982,239350,Spelunky,"WARNING: This game is SUPREMELY OVERHYPED and OVERRATED. This game is definitely NOT worth the price of admission. This game is so insanely brutal that it doesn't even make sense, buying this game and playing it is akin to spraining your ankles ON PURPOSE; why for the love of Pete, would you do that? Playing this game is the quickest way to get 'smashed monitor syndrome.'   Don't get me wrong, I LOVE games that are challenging. I 100%-ed Demon Souls on the PS3. Yet this game, this overhyped game, DOES NOT deserve the same kind of love other brutal games get. Demon Souls, Contra, Raiden, these legendary brutal games throw challenges at you and if you fail said challenges...you get punished with death. HOWEVER, Spelunky does not throw challenges at you...it throws DEATH at you. No matter how meticulously you play this game, you will NOT get to the end. The reason that this game, in my opinion, gets so much love is that it helped popularize the 'Rouge-like' gameplay, and for that kudos. I appreciate what you have done here. However! That does not excuse it from the poor execution. Being the FIRST does not make you the BEST. The iPod was not the first MP3 player, it was the best.  Gameplay: The first level starts at the volume turned to 11. Then each level only gets turned louder and louder till you bleed from every single orifice. This is how a typical session goes: Whip a creature, it doesn't die and it attacks you, you take 1 damage. Try to descend the level, fall too far: take 1 damage + get dizzy. Another creature walks by, you take another 1. Now you only have 1 life left, you try to be EVEN more careful, only to have some stupid ♥♥♥ spider triggers a trap...YOU DIE. And then you look at your palms and say to yourself...WAS I BORN WITH A MENTAL DISABILITY?!?! Answer: NO. But this game sure makes you question your sanity and mental capabilities.  I do acknowledge the innovative playing style. And I admit the first few hours were fun. But this game keeps you trapped within the first 5 or so stages that it's a shame you don't get to see all the other stuff in this world. And I think the BIGGEST shame is that getting so far requires SO MUCH dedication and sanity that when you have a choice to ACTUALLY do something different (City of Gold etc)... you are LITERALLY too afraid to do any exploration because you worked so hard to get to where you are. Think about that for a second folks...An ADVENTURE game that punishes you for trying to have an ADVENTURE. That's like using a toilet that shoots poop right back at you; why discourage me from doing what you were meant to do?  So would I recommend this game to anyone? No, not at all. Just watch a friend (or enemy…preferably enemy) pay $15 and play this game and then see how it goes. Trust me when I say, you will get at least 80% more enjoyment out of watching them play, then to play this game yourself. I used a statistic, so therefore…science.

All of the unlockable weapons and characters with a variety of different bosses makes this game consistantly fun and challenging. One of my only complaints with the game is that it is incredibly short compared to other action platformers as you can beat the main story in roughly 2 hours on Normal difficulty and 3 hours on Very Hard.  Bleed is very humorous, there are several points in the game where the main characters tells jokes referencing the fact that it's a video game, an example being near the beginning there's a pit that if you fall in is actually not instant death and the character comments on how she thought that would have been a cheap death. Every time you die Wryn (The main character) comments and either jokes about the death, encourages you to keep trying, or makes a reference, this can actually ease stress/anger slightly and makes you want to try again a little bit more than without it.

The goal of the game is to make games that are slightly, if marginally better the each previous game. If you make to rapid advancements and innovation too quickly than your games wont get more 'points' and you plateau. It becomes very tedious, and for what? A question I cannot answer.  Final Thoughts: Going into this game I thought the point was to be innovative, make the best games you can and beat the compitition. But that is not the case, there is no compitition. The goal is to make crappy games, and games that are slightly less crappy than the last to bank on the system and become the next virtual EA. That's not my cup of tea.  If thats your thing go for it, but for me I was not impressed and this game is more of a novelty item if anything. If your really looking for a game dev simulator than it will scratch that itch for a brief moment and overall is 'lacking'.  4/10 Would not recommend  P.S. I was sold by the overwhelming positive reviews, but shortly realized my mistake. This game is a fun gimmick, but fades pretty fast. If the mechanics where better or there were other companies to compete with, and it was a race to get ahead and build a company that does at least something better than the others like how the big companies of today got going, which was what I expected, then this review would be much higher. But as it stands it was not even close. Perhaps I had my hopes to high, perhaps I was expecting something that 'Game Dev Tycoon' would offer, perhaps I was just foolish thinking a 96% favorable game could not disappoint.",-1,0
2235519,239840,Dead State,"All in all, I appreciate a game that brings the element of base building along with zombie combat. I don't tend to be very good 1st-person, as I fail at the twitch factor miserably (lol). However, it would be nice if there was a clock on the top of the screen at all times and pack animals, so we don't have to run back and forth to get everything. Also, more chickens and how about the ability to grow more by utilizing the roof and two other patios (so called because they look like the one that currently has the garden. Lastly, what about wandering zombies? When my party is our scavenging, how come they don't run into zombies in-route? I think these are easy additions (BTW - I'm in software as an SDET).   Now, if you really wanted to do something fun, you'd allow us to move to another location or add/remodel the shelter/school. I'd love to get access to the roof areas (including the other two patios). Now, this would be a big change, but one that would breath some more life into an already interesting, if not grindy game.   Anybody else have ideas?",1,0

2236095,239840,Dead State,"I like tactical RPGs like X-Com, Jagged Alliance, etc. So I thought I'd like this game, and I did for a while. Until the complete lack of polish started to get to me. I don't FEEL like I'm in a zombie apocalypse. I feel like an errand boy for a bunch of whiners. Characters in the game are always the same, they always want the same thing (deoderant, coffee, batteries) which raises their mood level (gotta keep morale high). However since they are unchanging, it feels like I'm constantly grinding to keep their mood high by bribing them with things I find.   For example, the one cop you start with has a gun but he says he's never used it before. You can ask him for it but he refuses. You can continue to ask him for it forever and he will always refuse. I don't understand why these dialogue options exist if they do nothing. This game is also quite flat and has very little in the way of randomization. If you restart the game you'll find all the same loot in all the same places. I do understand that this is an indie developer, however I don't think they should've undertaken such an ambitious project.  I payed full price for this game, but after playing it, I'd say I'd pay about 10$ for it.",-1,0

2257331,24010,Train Simulator,i have played this for a long time now but i wouldn't reccomend it based on the way they handle content. they don't fix bugs and nearly all the content is expensive dlc. (one of which i bought lost all it's career missions on an update..) so it's rather niche and you need to be a serious anorak to play the 125 minute long scenarios that you could play by setting the accelerator and putting the kettle on while it trundles down the line for an hour. it's got its good points but i don't feel they are weighing up the bad points. ,-1,1

I set the resolution to 1600x900 - windowed mode, and the same issue persisted.   - The combat is very clunky, and blood flys from your SWORD rather than the ENEMY you attack, very weird.  - Some of the UI is cut off on the bottom, you can only see half of your icons on the hot bar which makes it frustrating to see which hotbar icons you are clicking or pressing via keyboard.   - The game itself is visually appealing, and very pretty. Models are great, and the character design is very intuitive. Character creation is similar to WoW/MMO-like.  Overall, very good visual state, just some lacking issues with the video displays, UI, and mouse overlay.",-1,0

2265108,240760,Wasteland 2,"Armed with a more meaningful skill system, interesting characters and thrice as shorter in time, this could have been a great game. But as it is it's only decent.  There are only two ways to play this game: distribute all the non-useless skills among your crew or prepare your ♥♥♥ to get continuously ♥♥♥♥ed in the second half. Forget roleplaying and meaningful characters: they are just upgradeable slots for your skills, 3 skills per head is about right. And, well, Scotchmo. And since skil budgeting is the key game element, you'll get constantly frustrated as you hire new crew members that deem your already distributed skills useless —unless you get a list of companions on the wiki beforehand and plan accordingly. And get a list of guns as well, as some of the fight skills fall into the “useless” category.  The story itself is not that bad, and the game delivers in terms of humour. But despite that, it's too long on the verge of  boring . It could have greatly benefited gameplay-wise by promoting importance to game choices:    allowing only the main player skills to be used outside combat — but I guess that would be against the Wasteland tradition;    allowing companion skills to be summed in some way that having several spesialists in, say, lockpicking, would be of benefit.   Right now I see little interest in playing a game that takes this much time and urges the players to use the same only-one-correct style. Seen one gameplay, seen them all.",-1,0

2269023,241260,Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments,"5/5 stars; overall great game. This game's top features are: nice variety of characters with all sorts of backstories; six different cases with dramatically different plots and settings; easy puzzles (and an option to skip if need be); straight-forward gameplay; amazing controls; outstanding voice acting and music, and; the best graphics I've ever seen in a Sherlock Holmes game.   The two cons I found with this game: in-game travel and crashing. You have to move from one location to the next many times during the game and this becomes tedious. Sometimes it will take ~30 seconds to load. As for the crashing, several times while playing, the game stopped responding and I was forced to close it.  If you like Sherlock Holmes or mystery games, this is a great game to add to your collection. It's a wonderful game, but honestly, I would recommned waiting for a sale price to purchase it.

2270335,241540,State of Decay,"This is just for Lifeline DLC, since Steam won't let me add it right there.  Do not buy Lifeline. It's utterly broken. Not only that, but some of the game mechanisms have been adjusted to be downright ridiculous. Original State of Decay was filled with bugs, but I've managed to get to it when most of that was apparently fixed. Unfortunately, as it seems, developers learned nothing and same thing happened here.  - Game hands down cheats. Zombie respawn is ridiculous - you clean a room, then you turn your back and few seconds later they're back. I think they've wanted to make this DLC more difficult, but there are better ways to do it without making the player feel cheated. - Also, when you make your game harder, make sure you'll also adjust survavability of the friendly AI. They were equally dumb in original, but there weren't many situations where AI gets surrounded by 10 zombies. AI doesn't know the term running away, they're mindless drones. I've lost several NPCs just because all they understand is to attack and when they get overrun, there is nothing you can do. - In fact, NPCs have problems doing even the simpliest things, like running through doors or getting in cars. - Car physics, if you can even call it that, makes them very easy to flip over, because we're apparently on moon. Two times I've been launched in the air with my car without doing anything else than getting close to some object (pathway, building). - Due to map design, lots of it happens in quite close quarters and corridors, which makes it excellent for your character to get stuck in group of zombies without any chance to get out. You can just watch your character glitch through them as you desperately mash buttons to no awail. - Reloading weapons sometimes doesn't work and works only when you zoom in. - When I say this ♥♥♥♥ is utterly broken, I mean it. When siege happens, if you're in middle of saving someone, you magically can't talk to them, which forces you to leave them and come for them again, if they manage to survive. I don't know how long have they tested this DLC, but there are huge issues that anyone has to run into after few minutes of playing... - Last but not least, you would think that soldiers will be a little more competent with firearms than civilians, but no, your teamates can't shoot for their life, and they're more than happy to let their fellow soldiers to die and continue shooting like it's 4th July.  The home defence system just doesn't outweight so many problems this DLC has, and it's not so fun as it might seem at first, because sieges usually happen when you least need it.

The game goes on and on in a surprisingly addicting and entertaining experience.  For the price you'll typically find this game going down to, this is a no-brainer purchase for the fun you'll get out of it if you enjoy rogue-likes, 2d action adventures, or simple arcade fun.

2292351,241910,Goodbye Deponia,"I wanted to like this game, I really did. The first game in the series was pretty enjoyable, if a little short, and the art style and setting were unique enough to allow me to get past the loathsome main character. The second game was maybe a little better, with better puzzles at least, and I really looked forward to the final game in the series.  But it was terrible. Start to finish, this game was terrible. The puzzles were contrived, overly complicated, and all but required a walkthrough to complete. A good adventure game has some logical connection between different puzzles, with items that conceivably could be combined or used together to move the character further along the story. If that's what you're looking for, look someplace else.  Well if the puzzles were bad, maybe the story was good? Nope. I won't spoil anything, but an interesting twist revealed about halfway through has no real implication on the ending - despite the world-changing ramifications of it, all it amounts to is an excuse to make puzzles more convoluted. The main character, Rufus, only becomes more obnoxious and disgusting as the game goes on until you're just left feeling filthy for having helped it all happen.  And the ending. Don't listen to the people who talk about redemption, about 'people only wanting a happy ending', or any of the other long-winded explanations for why this is a good ending. It isn't. It's terrible. My wife and I just sat there watching the credits until we both realized that yes, that was it, that was really how this trilogy was going to end. It was a massive disappointment and I just want my time and money back.  Please don't buy this game.",-1,0

2293158,241930,Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™,"Sleeper hit of 2014, I was really happy to see this game receive the praise and attention it deserved. I am a big fan of the Tolkien IP and I was nervous this game was going to be another attempt to cash in on loyal fans purse strings. I made an apprehensive day one purchase and could not have been more surprised by the quality and fun this game provided. Shadow of Mordor is a mash up of Assassins Creed stealth approaches to enemies, with a lethal style of Batman combo combat. One feature that I did not read in many reviews that I really enjoyed was going on revenge missions when an Orc captain killed one of your STEAM friends who were also playing the game. I always made any orc who killed a fellow Ranger public enemy #1. Of course as mentioned in every review the Nemesis system was a lot of fun and made my play-thru feel personal and special. I am looking forward to seeing what WB and other developers do with it in future titles.",1,0
2293686,241930,Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™,"This game was amazing. This game was fun. I was having an absolute blast playing this game and would have rated it a 10/10..... UNTIL.... I met my first (near) unkillable captain. He was immune to melee, ranged, stealth. He had poison weapons that would kill you in 2 hits. He was enraged by flies. He ran super fast. He COULD be damaged by special attacks but didn't take much damage. I WAS EXCITED FOR THE CHALLENGE!!!   After ambushing him during his trial I finally killed the ♥♥♥♥er while exploiting his weakness to fire so that he wouldn't come back. I was elated and was having a blast!!  Then, after I chopped his head off, he came back to life. This time he was even stronger AND had a body guard.  Tried over and over to kill him. He was the only thing standing between me and progressing in the story line. Finally killed him. HE CAME BACK TO LIFE.  While it's a hilarious story to tell it absolutly killed the game for me. I want to play. I love the challenge.

2298466,241930,Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™,"The entire game is disappointing. Basically it's a melt of every game out there but badly done. Nothing makes sense, whether it is the gameplay, game mechanics, level design, overall progression, story...  So Mordor really is 'that' big? Actually it is one of the smallest open world maps ever and I haven't mentioned the cheap level design; repetitive and empty, but first and foremost it is pointless again.  The gameplay itself look like it was rushed by developpers. Every mechanic introduced lacks a missing part. The system behind the gameplay is useless (eg: Sauron's army). You can just kill everyone on your path the same way and repeat it until the end of times. The powers, upgrades or anything else are useless.  Don't waste your time, this is not the ultimate Lord of the Rings video game that you have been dreaming of for the past 15 years. Someday perhaps.",-1,1
2299153,241930,Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™,Good graphic but combat is super boring. There is no challenge in this game. There will be only 1 boss where you might have some problems rest and even final boss is just a matter of pressing the button! Wait for sale.,-1,0

2300381,241930,Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™,"Shadow of Mordor is an amazing game that should be played by anyone who has a powerful enough rig to handle it. It has great controls, fluent combat which is reminiscent of the Arkham and Assassin's Creed games, and the Nemesis System to boot. The Nemesis System in Shadow of Mordor really sets it apart from the haze of other AAA titles. It incorporates a deep, fleshed out hierarchy of Orcs in the Middle Earth universe. You can partake in this hierarchy by eliminating Uruks or Branding them, essentially making them your minions. All in all, Shadow of Mordor is by far the best game I have played in 2014, and I anxiously await the obligatory sequel and franchise that will soon follow.",1,0

Things that are annoying. No autorun, yeah I'm lazy. Also the key combos cramp my hands a bit. I suppose I could have changed the key bindings. All in all very enjoyable. I would say if anything it lacks some real epic battles.",1,0

2305191,241930,Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™,"So I haven't purchased a AAA title in a while but when I saw this game come on sale, I just had to buy it, I'm not the biggest fan of Middle Earth/Lord of the rings but I have to say this game is absolutley amazing!  Though I'm not a fan of Middle Earth this game pleased me and I very much enjoyed the content in this game. This game has the same fighting mechanics as Assasin's Creed and Batman Arkham series and I love how the fighting  flows   in those games. The game looks stunning in many ways. The game also has a benchmark feature which I will tell you is pretty cool. There's some stuff in this game that are amazing! Like if your character dies the person that killed you will be risen up in the ladder to become a warchief (Highest enemy level) and when you fight them again they will remember you and what you did to them. So if you were to have set them on fire, they will remember that, I haven't played too much of the story but the story seems really great. Another thing I like about this is your basically playing as two people. Though they share the same body (Don't want to say anything else or i might spoil the game for you). The game also has an amazing skill tree which allows for many new abilities, which I very much enjoyed.  There are some things I do not like about the game, such has the game needing 6GB of Vram to run textures at ultra, which I find ridiculous also after a while the 'Big boss battles' don't feel very hard, you can let a certain character kill you and get stronger but I want a strong villain, someone that will give you a challenge. Also another con is the game can get pretty repetitive after you have unlocked everything from the skill tree.  All in all, would I recommend this game? Yes I very much would, its a very fun game and flows nicely when you fight, Also since the game is open world you will have sidequest luckly I have the season pass so I will be able to get DLC and upcoming DLC. If you are a type of person that wants alot of exploration and enjoy the Assasin's Creed and Batman Arkham series you will enjoy this. If you want a game that will give you a challenge and make the game hard at some points, I won't recommend it to you. Easy as that.",1,0
2305335,241930,Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™,"First off, let me say that I'm a huge LOTR fan, and I'll likely play this game, regardless of what I consider to be flaws. However, the character controls aren't terribly intuitive, and don't seem to respond consistently. I find myself using the same controls over and over, because those controls actually respond. Second, there are some serious clipping and collider concerns in the game. It's sometimes difficult to move past obstacles when you're in stealth mode. Items like rocks and walls can cause you issues if you're in stealth mode, and trying to get around those items when the Uruks spot you. In another instance, I was climbing a wall, to get to an archer, and ended up inside the wall, without a way to get out, or away. I was just stuck, hanging there.   Those things make this a frustrating game experience for me. It's not really a smooth gaming experience, despite the beautiful graphics.",-1,0

Striking with the mindset of revenge and to break the bond that has been forced upon you you'll roam the land of Mordor striking fear into your enemy's.

2316542,24200,DC Universe Online,"I would love to be able to recommend this game, but I can't. The premise is good enough: a massive multiplayer game in which you play the role of a superhero, but the game itself suffers from some serious flaws.  Firstly there is the multi-player aspect. The game itself is set up with two distinctively different types of gameplay. Player against the environment, and player against player. Player against the environment consists of performing missions in order to gain experperience so a character can be leveled up, this consists of very little interaction with other players making this form of the game have more in common with a single player game. By contrast the player vs player aspect to the game focuses on fighting the other players in various forms of duels. This means that your character can be attacked by other players at any time and often players will gang up on another player (three against one for example).   The biggest problem with the PVE/PVP setup is that the equipment that your character has also comes in these two diferent flavours, is significantly stronger for PVP, AND IS NOT INTERCHANGEABLE. This means that if you enter a mission ALL your PVP (player vs player) equipment will instantly deactivate leaving your character extremely vulnerable. Going the other way if you switch from PVE (player vs environment) to PVP your character will be so weak that they are quickly killed by other players. The only way around this is to constantly change the equipment you are using.  In PVE mode the game quickly becomes boring. Even with a range of different missions the basis of the game remains almost exactly the same. Enter an area, kill everything there, collect something, kill the boss; it gets VERY repetitive. And the storylines don't alter. Make up a character with the same 'mentor' and you will get exactly the same missions.  The game is also crippled for free players. If you do not buy either a membership or an All Access Pass you are severly disadvantaged. Even if you buy the expansion packs you will still be limited to only $1,000 of in game currency or $2,000 if you make a purchase with real cash. This makes a membership essential.  But, there is a significant problem with memberships as well. Like all of the 'All Access Pass' games Sony has made it impossible to merge log in names. This means if you have DC Online on a different log in from your other Sony games the All Access Pass will NOT work. Every game has to be on a single account. Sony will also DELETE your characters, if you don't play for a while.  All up this combination of critical flaws makes for a game that could have been so much more, but is simply a huge dissapointment.  UPDATE: On top of all the issues mentioned above, Sony do NOT take any action whatsoever on abusive players, leaving the game wide open for those who want to harrass and bully fellow gamers. The reporting procedures are ridiculosly difficult, involving an in game report followed by an official complaint placed on their site, only for Sony to take no action whatsoever. Definately not worth bothering with.",-1,0

Much of the content is rehashed from first game, there are a few heists outside of that though which is good enough.  Most of the base game is locked behind the DLC paywall. It's not 'oh there's some heists I could buy or weapons I could unlock with the DLC at some point if I got bored' it's the game constantly going 'OH YOU DONT HAVE THIIIIIIIIIIIIIS DLC OR THIIIIIIIIIIIIS DLC OH I BET YOU'D LIKE THIS WELL BETTER GET THIIIIIIIIIIIIS DLC'. The game is entirely built around this idea that even after owning the game you should be constantly harrassed and advertised to to squeeze out a few more pennies.

It's initially fun to play with friends, but I got bored quickly when it turned into 'grind for 30 minutes until you get the objective against hundreds of mindless AI robocops that are only difficult because of their numbers'. It just feels like it's incredibly bland and monotonous to encourage you to buy more from them.  One of the mover overhyped, over-rated games on Steam.",-1,0

2340857,242680,Nuclear Throne,"-Updated review-  Nuclear Throne is a Indie game simply done right.  It sticks to its base gameplay and the devs have made vast quality of life improvements for the players and I respect that.  Its fun fast paced playstyle keeps you coming back for more even though your last death was bull!@#$ and that car that blew up that killed you was nowhere near you!  The topdown shooter has multiple characters that you can choose from, some locked some hidden, each with their own unique ability.  Guns on guns on guns. Nuclear Throne is full of fun unique guns to use. Energy weapons, bullets melee, explosions. The guns are the icing on the cake. Finding your favorite in the mists of a firefight is crazy fun. Combining perks with what load out you hope to find out there is an absolute blast.  The quite moments in the game are a blessing because its a constant battle from every stage to every bossfight. Chaos ensures as the game progresses but its flat out fun every bit of the way.  The retro like style is timeless and easy on the eyes making every playthrough or restart less frustrating. Its the best style for this game and I really think they hit the nail on the head.  10/10 You'll absoultly get your moneys worth with this game.",1,0

2346185,242700,Injustice: Gods Among Us Ultimate Edition,"The game is awesome, just pure awesome. With the PC being so poorly loved by fighting games, I cant help but to feel pride and joy that in the last years the most succesful games of this genre are making their appearance on PC Master Race. Mortal Kombat 9 has introduced an awesome story mode something that is revolutionary for me in fighting games and Injustice continues this great tradition by doing the same. To put it simple, there whole story is like one big movie where you as player come in whenever a duel happens in the story. So there is some story going on, then two characters clash and you do the fighting in a normal 1 round combat. And it is awesome! The story have Batman and Joker (and couple other DC heroes) travel to alterantive dimension where Superman has gone mad after Joker's did a 'killing joke' on him and right after he snaps Jokers neck in front of Batman he starts creating 'new order' of things by killing every bad guy on earth (except for those who surrendered and plegded their loyalty to him) destroying governments and establishing One Earth of which dictat... ekhm! leader he becomes whereas Batman has established an underground resistance who's members are mostly bad guys! And the arrival of Batman and couple others from the well known to all dimension of DC things start to get hot and leading to a full blown epic battle (or you could even call it WAR) where all your favorite DC character clash in a way you rarely see (Batman fighting Batman!)  I am not a maniac however just a amateur enthusiast of such games so I wont tell you if the fighting system is deep enough for a maniac who expects complexity that will satisfy his develop super fighting skill but to me the game style is good enough and complex. Moreover, every character in game has a special ability that is unique for him which is impresive given that there is a load of characters to choose from.

I personally really like this game because I'm a huge fan of World War II first person shooters, so why not try out a World War I shooter? I think it's pretty epic if you ask me. The only cons to this game is that it is very poorly optimized and does require a good CPU to play it. I have an AMD Athlon x4 II 645 clocked at 3.1 GHz with 4 cores. It always stutters and I get frames in the teens and 20s. I just ordered an AMD FX 6300 in hopes of much better performance mostly in the Battlefield franchise.

2398700,242920,Banished,"I'm a long time fan of the Tropico and Anno games. This game can be considered to be a similar genre but has enough unique element to stand out on its own.  You manage a small colony of villagers and the goal of the game is to survive and prosper with limited resources. There are no monster to fight or invaders to fend off but is by no mean is this game easy. Your villagers will die if they starve, if the freeze in the harsh winter, or from natural disasters like fire and tornados. A barn burned to the ground In the winter can very well wipe out your entire village by starvation and spell game over for you. As the leader you have to carefully manage your human resources, do I need more people to gather firewood for the winter? Out do I use those wood and man power to build housing to shelter then from the snow? This game if full of these decisions and can get really hard very soon. Don't let this serene screenshot fool you into thinking that this is a relaxing game.  The game has a very intuitive UI that's very easy to pick up and the tooltips does a great job explaining what does what. Graphic is simple and elegant although zooming in you can tell it doesn't have the details of triple A titles. It is really neat just watch your villagers going about they business and they are very well animated and interesting.  The are some pathing or AI issues such as my hunter would walk right past a deer and not hunting it, but they are minor and not game breaking.  The music is beautiful and atmospheric. But the sound is a bit repetitive and annoying, I have a mine next to my village and the constant mining sound is driving me crazy.

2400705,242920,Banished,"What an excellent game! I will address the vanilla game and then the mod I'm currently running (Colonials Charter: Excellent Adventure).  The vanilla game is approachable and very addictive. My work suffered a coup[le days because I had to stay up to build that Tailor or wait for that merchant to come in to get cows so I can make coats for my freezing people. This game makes you feverishly watch your food, tool, and firewood counts. Reserves of these vital resources are mandatory for long-term survival. I will say vanilla has a couple balance issues, like the fishing dock being less efficient source of food. Since Banished has a thriving mod commuinity on Steam's Workshop, the game has many possibilities. Before trying Colonial Charter, definitely play Vanilla for a while to get use to game mechanics. Then jump into the twice-as-complicated world of CC:EA. That mod adds more resource chains and many more buildings and crops. Unfortunately, due to certain limitations of Vanilla, the mod cannot effectively show you how to control all these cool new things you're producing. A needed and interesting addition to vanilla never the less. Crossing my fingers for Banished 2....",1,0

No two games end up the same, each one requiring it's own carefully thought out tactics, it's a nightmare. A glorious nightmare.  There are a few areas in which the game could very much be improved upon, such as having no preview of the map you're going to get prior to starting a game (which means it can be lengthy as loading for a large or medium map is longer than a small one), and a terrain builder or the chance to make your own world would be great, but alas, you'll spend hours of your life on it regardless.",1,0

But I really love the graphics, sound, and AI. Nobody is dumb, all AI act lively. Sounds and graphics make up the most to this stunning game.  Yet, why the bad review?  Simply one thing, and one thing only. Content without getting new buildings from the workshop, the game seems dull with only like 20 buildings. It is very plain, as it shows that you can build a huge kingdom, when I feel like I am just building a small colony.  What can Banished to to be better?  1. An easier mode to start with. (I'm bad) 2. WAY more buildings, like- bank, or barracks. (this leads to my 3rd) 3. Military- Nomads will come and ask to be part of your village. How about a mode where they can go to war with you? Make people become soldiers, armed with weapons and armor, all could be made in a barracks. The blacksmith can make weapons and provide to the barracks which will distribute to soldiers. Send them off to fight or defend. Build walls and towers. Can't be attacked more than once within 4 years or something. Better weapons and armor can be researched in maybe a new building. 4. Quests- Maybe merchants will tell you, 'Get me a treasure buried somewhere over there' or 'Defeat the nearby nomads' to earn food, XP (will be explained in 5th), or livestock. 5. The ability to, after doing challenges or quests to earn XP, progress to the next age or era. From the colonial age to modern, build an empire. (maybe to ambitious) 6. Realistic government- you can make rules, like nobody can own more than 2 weapons, or must work for food, or even pay taxes in whatever you choose. 7. Currency, like real currency. You choose this at the start- Whether you start to use money or coins at currency at your village, people around will. Use these to buy ♥♥♥♥ from merchants.

2408421,242920,Banished,"I would actually give this game a 'Not Sure' rating. This is an amazing game and piossibly the best strategy/survival sumulator I have played. I did enjoy it and wouldn't change anything, but would at least add things but I was forced to stop playing because after 15hrs of playing, I feel like that one person who actually ready that one shirt 'How do yo keep an idiot busy? (see back of shirt). For me, the equivalent was spending hours on maps just to hit a brick wall when you reached a point where everyone died of stupidity, or at least the precipice of the programming.  Cons: -After 10 plus maps that I spent hours trying to sustain a population of 12+ and making a town, those 10+ games ended with people starving within an hour+ into the game. The one before last everybody was hungry, there was no food, even though I had 4 crop fields, two orchards, a hunting cabin, a fishing area, and a gatherer. My very last game made me quit, because I was building houses for my homeless people when they suddenly just stopped all building at 30% and walked around aimlessly. I used the priority tool, I made everyone builders, I needed another stock pile for everything they had (I even had a Market Place) yet they all idled all over the land, far from even where they were supposed to be working as farmers. In the end, the 12 people I ended with were content to share two houses when they needed warmth instead of building the 5 houses they were supposed to build and use just to wander around aimlessly with 'House' symbols over their head, giving up their jobs just to starve to death. Tell them to tear a tree down it's a mass exodus to fullfill that one order. After that, wander aimlessly, some even winding up roughly the equivalent of 300+ feet away from anything that was being built or farmed. I had built a school to teach how not to be stupid, but that remained undone at 10%.   Pros:  -This is a wonderful game, the graphics are nice, it's really is beautiful, the controls are easy and I got the hang of it in no time, but this glitch or whatever it is that makes them stop, make it stop. I will continue to play this game, but I will use the Debug tool just so I can pop in more people that can just walk around aimlessly and not build a damn thing.   So to all reading, yet I have played this game for 15 hrs, yes I played multiple maps and started differently in every way, always created a food source and homes first, used the priority tool when needed. Only on my last two attempts did I create the Hunter's Cabin first instead of after the crops and it worked out wonderfully, untill everyone just stopped building, eating and caring. I wasted all this try trying so many thing to make this game work for me and trying to convince myself it was just this map or this save got corrupted, but after 15hrs of trying to convince yourself, I let go og the ghost and decided to walk away from the money and hours wasted and trying to revive a dying horse and just went to play with another one.   This game must have a bug because I am not the only one who has issues with this and had used attempts that others have suggested.   NOTE: *This is my personal opinion and thoughts of the game, not an overall proffesional view if the game for general audience to use as a guide.

2411781,243120,,"Amazing game, but doesn't feel polished up to it's potential. It's been a long time since I've played Betrayer, and for my first few hours of the game, it was pretty entertaining. One moment I'd be shooting down one guy only then to be fighting three more monsters that caught on to what happened. Another moment I'd be in the Underworld, dodging energy blasts, staving off angry banshees, and doing something similar to a 'run and gun' shootoff. Graphics are pretty, and if you're like me and you turned the color way up, the world looks very beautiful and lush. On top of that, the monsters (despite them losing their scare after a while) are fairly good at making you panic, be it a giant armored bear(?) chucking rocks at you or a banshee making cheap blows from behind.  I guess the only thing this game is missing is the desire to come back. Despite some of the fights being pretty entertaining, the combat feels kind of dull. Stealth is also annoying and arbitrary, as most of the time you kill one monster and then everybody else knows exactly where you are.  Another issue is that the story (and how you figure things out) isn't nearly as satisfying as how other games dish out story. There's nothing wrong with the 'whodunnit' detective style of figuring what happened to people in the abandoned camps, but when you discover that 'this person killed herself over the reckless accidental suicide of her child,' you don't get the emotional 'pow' you normally get from some other game. This would probably be because of the heavy text-based dialogue or the complete absence of cutscenes, but I don't want to bash the devs for lack of resources.  All in all, this game is enjoyable in some sense, but it can be really hard to keep playing it, especially if there's other games to play. You might want to pick up this game if it's on sale; despite its lack of keeping you fully engaged, the trading cards are cheap and the backgrounds and emoticons are really cool.",-1,0
2411804,243120,,"==Spoiler Free==  I highly recomend Betrayer, for the following reason: You can have a Bow.  All In-jokes I have with my friends aside, I just spent ten hours playing Betraying, enjoying every minute of it. Could I have finished it faster? Probobly. Should I have? No, since I enjoyed exploring, trying new tactics, and just generally goofing around while playing it.  Looking at the reviews of Betrayer on the popular gaming news sites would give someone the impression that Betrayer is an okay game at best, filled with repetative, boring moments at the end. IGN gave it a 5/10 because of that.  I wholeheartedly disagree, for multiple reasons.  +First off, IGN are the corprate ♥♥♥♥♥s who literally give every ♥♥♥♥♥♥ CoD game a '10/10, it was okay', and shill Mt. Dew and Doritos at every chance they can, so they can go ♥♥♥♥ off.  +Secondly, there was not a single moment in the game that I didn't enjoy. I died a few times, sure, but I never got upset at it. +I've never felt my heart race while playing a video game before, but Betrayer did that for me. Crouching in the shadows, hearing the Loon calls of the savage Burned Men getting louder as they got closer and searched for me, I couldn't help but grow anxious, and when their calls turned to War-Whoops (well, louder, more agressive Bird Calls...) I felt a shivver run down my spine. +I've never felt such satisfaction with completing Side-Quests and hunting for Treasure, in any video game, but Betrayer made me feel very, very satisfied. Each time I found a chest filled with gold, or dug up a nice weapon (I'm looking at you, Trickster's Pistol!) I very very satisfied, and very happy. +The game, despite having map markers to show where Treasure/NPCs/Totems or whatever can be found, doesn't hold your hand and give you a big blot on your compas saying 'HERE IT IS, DON'T POKE AROUND AND LOOK, HERE IS THE ITEM!'. The thrill of discovery felt genuine, much like in The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, unlike The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion or The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, or any other first person game out there. +The sound quality of the game was great, I never once muted it out of annoyance +Unique stealth mechanics with the wind. Waiting for the wind to blow so I can dash out of cover and get up close to cut the throat of a Spaniard was very, very thrilling and fun. More games need to do this. +Sensible controls. The G key throws Tomahawks, the B key throws Grenades, the F key is for activating NPCs/Items, C causes you to croutch walk, and Left Shift causes you to sprint. WASD for movement... The people who made this obviously know what they are doing, and designed it well. +Fun Storyline. No spoilers, but the plot was awesome! +Realistic weaponry. Arrows have an arc to their flight, Crossbows are powerful enough to oneshot a man in heavy armor, and the blackpowder weaponry has realistic damage - A good pistol shot at close range to the torso would drop any man. Muskets aren't horiffically inacurate at close range as well, so that is nice. +Your Choices actually mater. Not spoiling anything, but they mater!  Now, the issues I have with the game: -I wish the Maid in Red had a voice actress. -Uhh...   All in all, Amazing game. 11/10, would (and will!) play again.   Oh, and btw - IGN can go ♥♥♥♥ off and die. Every ♥♥♥♥♥♥ CoD game gets a '10/10, it was okay I guess' from the borderline ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Ivory Tower gaming 'Journalists' at IGN, but this game only gets a 5/10? Obviously those cucks over at IGN wanted Blackpowder to grease their palms with a little extra special crap, and I'm glad they didn't.",1,0
2411971,243120,,"Betrayer is one of the better horror games out there. You roam across large maps, fighting against wandering undead and piecing together both the history of a lost colony and what you need to do to making things right again. This might be my favorite thing here - you don't just work out the story, you also have to work out how you go about to make things happen.

2415112,243470,Watch_Dogs,"I enjoy the game, while it is a bit overhyped I somehow managed to avoid ALL media about it except for the 2012 E3 demo. However, it is nowhere near worth the money and is overall very mediocre and not what was promised to the players.  PROS of the game: - Good graphics (although nowhere near the E3 2012 demo quality) -New hacking concept is pretty entertaining, especially during car chases and side-quests/collectibles. -Going back to the collectibles, some of those are actually entertaining to collect (e.g. the eavesdropping/spying on random people) -Overall, a lot of content in this game -The game somehow runs at 50-60 FPS on Ultra settings on my Nvidia Geforce GTX 680 AMP! edition and an old 3rd gen i7-930 2.80 GHz (with 10 GB of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 1333 MHz RAM).  CONS: -All of the above gets old very, VERY quickly. -Big letdown in terms of 'unique, living city' and 'car chases, parkour'. The only parkour in this game includes jumping over a fence or climbing onto a low rooftop through a pre-determined path, the car handling physics feel like I'm playing GTA III (GTA IV is heaps better on PC). The city is by no means 'living' - again, GTA V has a much better atmosphere to it. -Uninspired, generic vehicles, nothing unique and entertaining. -No hand-to-hand combat system beyond 'press a button to take a guy down before he alerts the others'. -Stealth is very shallow (see the point above), even the hacking doesn't save it. -Terrible, very very generic gunplay (even the 'bullet-time' doesn't save it) with a mundane collection of weapons. -There is a stupid and completely unnecessary 'reputation system', which ruins all encounters with the police by making the player 'hated by the public'/diminishing your reputation. In short, you can't even go into a killing spree. -Terrible ragdoll/pedestrian physics. Yet again, GTA IV kicks ♥♥♥ in this department.  -From what I have heard, the game runs terribly on much better rigs than mine (which is very surprising but unacceptable nonetheless).   VERDICT: Get GTA IV and EFLC bundle and be done with it. Much, much, muuch better story, gameplay, driving physics, gunplay, not to mention tons and tons of humour, a big city with far more 'life' to it, plus the huge potential modding gives it (want to become Iron Man?

I didn't purchase this game to have some kind of stupid driving challenge game.  It's supposed to be a game about a hacker who's either ruthless or a vigilante, and he's out for revenge while making Chicago his plaything.  But no, that's obviously not what it is supposed to be. It's obviously a driving challenge game and compared to others in the open world genre, it simply sucks. I can imagine what you're thinking - 'wait, it's not a driving challenge game' - well, as the game progresses, you cannot complete the campaign unless you preform some of the most annoying driving challenges around.  And when will game developers learn that when I die and get restarted at a check point, that they should give us the option of skipping the cutscene intead of watching it time and time again?

2423549,243930,Bound By Flame,"Bound by Flame is a 3rd Person Action RPG by Spiders Studios. You play as a mercenary who must save his land from a walking dead army through the use of powers granted to you by a demon.  Bound by Flame is very rough around the edges, full of 'jank' as some lovingly, or not so lovingly, describe. It is evident in myriad ways, from the dialog, to animation, to overall plot of the story. This is not some extremely polished AAA title, but it is not without its charm. Ultimately it had enough of that charm to keep me playing until I completed the story.  The gameplay is similar to Legend of Zelda, or a very paired down God of War. There are no combos, kill streaks, or anything of that sort. You can parry, block and dodge attacks; choose from 3 main strong style weapons (axe, hammer, sword); try stealth mode with daggers; or use a small selection of fire-based spells to attack your enemies. Combat can go a little slow at times, with some enemies having a lot of health, and I found myself at times running around in circles so I could slowly heal or chug some health potions. Your companions are mostly useless, but the one that casts healing spells can come in handy at times. Overall, I wouldn't call the combat the game's strongest point, since it can get very repetitive. There is not much variety in types of attacks, and you will be battling the same types of enemies over and over and over.  The graphics in Bound by Flame are impressive for a smaller studio. There are glitches here and there with the occasional floating piece of armor, but overall I liked the way the world looked. Some of the character faces are a little bland, but I liked the look of most of the enemies.  The dialog and voice work was probably my favorite part of the game. There is a very peculiar sense of humor present in this game, with the hero never beyond dropping a witty one line when the option presents itself. I did find the frequent use of curse words to be quite funny, because who wouldn't want to drop an F bomb at an Ice Lord trying to take over your realm.  The story is not something that hasn't been seen before. You can see bits and pieces of other works present in the plot, but overall it works. I was a little surprised when the game ended, because it seemed like everything was just wrapped up a little too quickly and there were still many threats that were discussed but never addressed. Also, the endings didn't really do enough to tell you what happened. Some major characters were just never mentioned at all. One ending just cuts to the credits without really giving you any idea of what was going to happen. That was disappointing.  Overall, Bound by Flame is a game I can recommend, but just barely. I believe its short length works in its favor, because although there still seemed like there was much to do in Vertiel, there wasn't enough variety in combat and enemy types to keep me wanting to do it much longer. I enjoyed the ride for what it was, a campy 10-15 hour fantasy RPG.  Grade: B-",1,0
2423615,243930,Bound By Flame,"This is a great game. The dialogue between some of the characters is incredibly entertaining, and the live action combat combined with RPG upgrades results in a fun, yet skill-testing experience. Bound by Flame has quite a bit of replayability to explore: additional side-quests you skipped or failed in previous run throughs, different decisions during the storyline, upgrade different skills and builds, or spend time with different companions.  I really enjoyed the crafting and upgrading system the game has because it reflects a simple, in-field experience. The decision by the game designer to minimize the needs of the crafting helps the game move along instead of getting bogged down by complex material requirements or blueprints. Allowing some items to be further customized helps to eliminate the 'trouser checking' of some randomized item games, so I can get right back to playing. The balance is fantastic.  I think I bought this as part of a bundle without much thought and starting playing it because I was looking for controller based games I could play while relaxing on my couch, so this caught me off guard. I wasn't expecting much and found a wickedly cool game I know I will come back to over and over.",1,0

2424115,243930,Bound By Flame,"In a vaguely described but perfectly bland world, a generic hero with no personality to speak of, desperately tries to stop an unoriginal invasion of undead horde (as apparently orcs are to edgy and tentacle monsters from outer space are too cool). The hero is joined by an entourage of sidekicks I would never saw before If I never played any other game (Morrigan &lt;sorta-indecent-sorta-evil-and-yet-sexy-like-a-turnip&gt; ripoff, Tali/Aerie/Shani &lt;every-sexy-bookworm-ever&gt; ripoff, Carth/Sten &lt;my-life-is-forfeit-I-lost-my-reason-to-be&gt; ripoff, Every Elf Ever &lt;with 50% forgettable design more&gt; ripoff and witty yet still unfunny &lt;like rotting Alistair&gt; undead person). That perfect combination of cliches, filler and uncreativity allows me to focus all my attention on gameplay. Which (not surprisingly) is a ripoff of far better games. Bound By Flame is what we would get if Witcher 2 and Dragon Age 2 had an unloved child who tried (failing miserably) to be like Dark Souls and Mass Effect at the same time. Sadly the game works just fine and has no major bugs to speak of, which prevents it from entering so-bad-its-good cathegory which was its only chance to be remembered by anyone.

2427410,244160,Homeworld Remastered Collection,"We all know what made Homeworld great. We all know Gearbox made a visually stunning remaster. What needs to be said now is what Gearbox did to make the remaster a disappointment. While the following things may sound petty, they fundamentally change how the game is played and the emotional tenor of the story:  -removing formations -removing stances -removing fuel for strike craft -reworking repair mechanics (repairing is now not feasible in combat, it's more meant for between battles) -making diffculty scaling much more aggressive -replacing the ballistic simulation for random number generation combat  Homeworld was always a story of disempowerment. Of overcoming long odds at the brink of genocide. You were perenially starved for resources, and forced to be extremely careful when shepherding your tiny little fleet. Put your craft into evasive mode and they'll live longer. Put them into aggressive mode and they'll kill faster. Use your support craft to keep expensive ships alive from mission to mission. Use the almost Napoleonic wall formation to concentrate firepower, but don't try complex maneuvers with it. The level of care you had to put into your fleet assets, great and small, contributed a lot to the overall feel of the game.  Now, stances have been removed. Formations have no effect, and fall apart the moment your ships enter combat. Fuel for strike craft has been removed. Support ships are now so unwieldy and take so long to engage that they are only useful outside of combat. Individually these changes wouldn't be so bad, but taken together they rob Homeworld's story of it's gravitas, and it's gameplay of almost all its depth.  It's hard to care about your fleet because your ships are now throwaway items, and honestly there isn't much for you to do with them other than throw them at the enemy fleet and designate targets. What was once a game of tactics and risk management has been reduced to a laser light show. Pretty, but ultimately there isn't much for you to do but sit back and watch.  If you want a pretty game with all the familiar sights and sounds from the Homeworld we played back in 1999, then this fits the bill. If you want a game that captures either the spirit or the tactical depth of the original, then sadly you should look somewhere else.",-1,1

2428138,244160,Homeworld Remastered Collection,"Much has been written about the improved graphics in the game. The screenshots speak for themselves. But, unfortunately, apart from enchanced graphics there are few positive moments to notice.  The in-game speech seems to be recorded anew. I liked Makaan's voice. Fleet Command and Cpt. Soban are good, too. Karan is a bit… not like herself. But you won't probably notice that.   Planet Killers   theme from the last HW2 mission I've been anticipating the most is just absent. All the other aspects of sound and music are ok.  Cutscenes are renedered in 1080p and look just awesome. But the in-game video player is implemented poorly: horrifying lags are obvious, while Media Player Classic plays the same smoothly even at x4 speed, let alone at normal.  That is all for the good part. Now the bad part.  First, despite nice textures, all the animations and VFx are left as it was. No new interesting additions (such as docking bays holding grip of resource collectors while unloading resource units or a destroyer losing a part of hull being heavily damaged). The repair beams and welding flashes stay as they were, while the soul craves for something more spectacular and immersive. Some of capital ships just don't fit the Mothership docking bay, going through textures.   The Junkyard Dog turns ships in space as if they were made of near-weightless thin indestructible cardboard!  . Hiigaran miners dock 'through' Vaygr refineries, piercing the solid metal with antennas. Damage model is exactly as it was in Homeworld 2 — weird and unimpressive. And so on. Nothing positive has been done here since the Classics.  Procedure of taking a 'clean' screenshot is spectacular. To do that, you must manually disable all the HUD elements and deselect all ships, and having taken a screenshot set everything back as it was. All in all, nearly 10 key presses are necesarry to make a screenshot.  As the game is about playing, not watching, and the Homeworld series is a thrilling experience to play through, in 20-30 minutes you will completely forget about graphics and concentrate all efforts and attention on gameplay.  Hotkeys map seems to remain at the initial state. Most keystrokes are 2 or 3 keys combinations, scattered all over the keyboard without pretty much structuring. Learning and using those is a piano challenge. Nothing has been done to improve the keyboard controls.  The campaign felt hopelessly easy. Closer to the end of the game (each one) the resource pool grows to 6-digit magnitude. That causes 'why don't I build a full fleet of these and try them on something hopelessly well defended' thoughts. The overall state of the campaing indicates that by the time of release no one of the developers had taken a notepad and made a full playthrough of the campaign, marking bugs.   When the junkyard Dog at Karos snatches a ship, you are supposed to lose contact with it, but you do not. The ships are supposed to be disabled after that, but  sometimes  they are not. Sometimes the Dog just tries to place the second ship to where the first is located, thus getting stuck. The Karos Proximity sensors Net is composed of freshly-painted sensors with Hiigaran insignia on them...  . I have spotted a swarm of such mistakes during the playthrough.  Enemy AI can make a grown man cry. No cooperation between ships is observed, and any signs of intellectual activity within the enemy ranks seem absent. Sending frigates wave after wave into the same minefield is just an example of a typical AI routine. The multiplayer AI seemed a bit better to me. In campaign there is none.  Ship behavior is untouched (or even wasted a little). Single corvettes are ineffective (due to special placement of their turrets). That concerns all other ship types as well, so the ships with high coverage ratio are the most powerful ones. Optimal attack patterns or any means to assign them manually are absent: a bomber can grind a resource collector just standing in one place, but instead it will move at max speed, and on the second run won't shot a single round because of asteroids blocking the shot. So, fighters and corvettes are a pity to watch at (especially single ones, with no squads and poor coverage). Whenever a ship escapes to safety through Hyperspace, rest assured: all your forces will target the enemy base to avenge the humiliation. Repair corvettes and minelayers will go in the lead, as the most agressive and eager to fight.   The Gehenna border outpost will be as tough a target for a bomber aqs before: the start of the attack run is a fixed radius, the end is hear the enemy hull. So, the length of the run is negligible here and no real damage will be done. And that is instead of standing and grinding the target.   There are worse things. Sometimes resource collectors just get stuck in place cutely blinking the engines instead of mining. Sometimes one of the ships boosts to 4000 speed or so and goes darting to the enemy lines or making enormous circles. My opponent once said his collecors are stuck inside one another and unable to move. Sometimes two corvettes try to repair each other, so they can't dock and go waltzing up to the uppermost boung of the map.    Gravitation Wells do not affect Vaygr corvettes  , and Assault fighters had the kamikaze damage compared to a full-sized frigate each (has been corrected on 05-03-2015)  The user interface. The only thing I did not expect of it is to get  this much  worse. The largest button on the screen is 'Menu' — the button to be used 5-10 times in total. The next one in size toggles sensor view and is  never  used, as it is bound to the Space key (which is extremely convenient). Right under it is an enormous control group panel that does nothing. Fleet build queue reacts poorly (especially the pause button) and takes 3 keystrokes to open (3 more whenever a build-capable ship is built or lost). The lower right corner is occupied by never-used basic action commands, such as Attack or Move. Everything listed above and to be listed below is to be scaled manually: extremely small on dtfault and clumsy and self-intersected on larger scales. Build and Research queues provide as few useful information as possible, and have to be scrolled due to the command panel below. Selection and commands do not work near UI objects, selection mechanism is suboptimal, so in combat situations the UI is bound to fail you constantly. Building 50 fighters take 50 clicks. 50 more whenever you change your mind. Overall element placement inUI and credits sequence indicate it has probably been done by a secondary school boy in exchange for a day off school. There is (maybe was corrected on 19-03-2015) a place where one of the names was covered with the white frame around a picture. I haven't even started a talk about possible improvements of the original: robust and fast probe deployment, fast access to compact build options, advanced formation and beharior tweaks (must be implemented in 'real life', not only on the GUI.  Balancing factions is a great work. Great work yet to be done, as the task seems untouched by the developers. This task is in tight relations with ship behavior, so I don't even know where to start.   Stealth figters are worth a special mention: being the most advanced Kushan tech, they have less DPS than a scout, move slower, can't hit smaller targets at all, and can't do real damage to larger ones. With feaures this outstanding they should be permanently cloaked without decloak on attack.     SUMMARY:  to be straight and honest — this is an alpha. Totally raw; loads of aspects haven't received due attention. Multiplayer platform is good and priceless for seasoned players. Textures and models are great. Everything else has been neglected with or spoiled. And it is not the graphics what makes a really good game.",-1,1

2434281,244210,Assetto Corsa,"While this game seems to have an avid fanbase, and lots of people who swear by it, I can only speak for my own experience.  I bought this game a long time ago, and I bought it because it had VR support. Imagine, a beautiful racing game with VR support. At the time, that was fascinating.  What I didn't know was that they had 'temporarily' removed VR support from the game, in the same week that I'd bought it. This meant that I would never get the chance to try it in VR, as they never added it back in, even months and months later.  I can't tell you how the game works, how pretty it is, or how great the physics are, I've never actually played it.   My 'not recommended' is simply because they advertized it as 'SteamVR' when I bought it, and it's never actually worked for me.  Is the game good? I've heard it is. But, for me, this will remain on my library list as a sad reminder of a VR experience I was so excited to try, and never got the opportunity to.  :*(",-1,1
2436297,244450,Men of War: Assault Squad 2,"I bought this game after having been a long time fan of Men of War. I loved the amazing physics and incredible depth, and it's one of my favourite games of all time.  Assault Squad 2 on the other hand is a stinky piece of crap. They somehow managed to regress in the area of gameplay from the first game and the entire thing just feels soulless and rushed. The physics are completely unrealistic and boring to play with, which was the main appeal of the original game to me. I loved burning down entire buildings with molotovs to advance on a fortified position, yet in Assault Squad 2 things as little as sandbags are invincible bulwarks against even tank rounds.  i bought this in sale and feel ripped off",-1,1

2438249,244450,Men of War: Assault Squad 2,"Because of the time and energy I have put into this game (400+ hours), I feel I am now ready to make an informed review.This game is greatest game in history of all PC games. Period. It also has so much more potential. You can replay missions and scenarios over and over and the fact that the open and interactive environment and ballistics and physics engine make for unlimited possibilites. I love how every nuance is important in this game. I am a defensive player and this game is perfect for those individuals. Individuals that are germanic and order orientated and not just run and gun cowboys. If you struggle with ADD or have a short attention span, don't bother with this game---even on easy mode. This game is made for highly intelligent strategic thinkers who are also very talented tacticians. This is the closest digital experience I have found so far that allows me to immerse myself in and experience world war II realistically and without an Allies bias. The fact that is is underfunded, made by a small game studio and is still full of bugs and crashes way too often, has not stopped me from clocking in over 400 hours now. I am world war II and RTS fanatic. The only game I have played more than this would be Company of Heroes 2 at 950hours on record. I have subsequently stopped playing company of heroes often when I came across this game. I hope that more money gets invested in this game and a greater financial incentive is placed on the developers to make this game more stable, less buggy, and support SLI and crossfire support and run natively at 64bit. I have had memory related errors on this game litterally thousands of times and it is very frustrating to crash out while in the middle of battle. I have 64GB of RAM, 4x water cooled AMD 290x and a water cooled intel 4960X.... my system is NOT anemic but I do concede that I play the game at 4k resolution. The user interface and text is horrrifically small when playing at 4k and changes from the developers to support 4k users should be a top priority. We are the users who would have paid $1000 for this title. Considering how much money I invest in hardware and digital technology, how valuable my time is worth in the market, and how much I have invested in free to play WWII titles like war thunder and World of Tanks, $1000 for a more refined version of this game would unquestionably be a bargain for people like myself. If your smart and intelligent, love world war II with an unrelenting passsion, and enjoy realistic hardcore RTS titles (not just dumbed down starcraft) this is without a doubt the greatest investment you will make thus far in your life. I cannot stress this point enough and I am bias only because I want more money to be put into this game to make it better. It's incredible but has so much further to go and holds so much promise. If you have any questions about the game, I am always open to talking to people about it. You can email me at  bekraus@gmail.com  or add me on facebook at  www.facebook.com/bekraus    Good Luck on the Battlefield and may the best man be victorious,   Ben Kraus CEO Kraus Industries",1,0

2443055,244710,Shelter 1,"Genre: Escort Game  Summary: Play as a mother badger who guides her 5 cubs away from hazards by moving between relay points.  Pros: - The game's art style and environments are vibrant and pleasing to look at.  - The game uses colour and shading to guide or teach players, such as during the sequence with the rapids.  - Attention to detail, such as musical cues and cubs increasing in size with each level, add to the presentation.  Cons: - At times, it is difficult to discern the direction you should go. - The sequences involving hawks (a type of hazard) appear in excess and are tedious to play. - The overabundance of food is counteractive to resource management and makes it pointless for players to explore and forage.  - It is difficult to differentiate the similar looking cubs. - The colour scheme of the pupss makes it difficult to discern levels of hunger.  - The game does nothing to instigate the player's attachment to the pups and expects players to care about them dying out of a sense of maternity or humanity.  - There are abrupt hazards at certain points of the game, such as the narrow pass in the finale, that don't prepare the player and punish them for behaving as normal.  - The hawk can glitch and disappear for a duration of time.  Neutral Points: - The music gives each level a unique tone but the tracks themselves are rather bland. - You can restart levels without penalty (permanently losing a cub); however, the lack of this feature, in this type of game, would be a turn-off for some players.",-1,0

Also there is a point system (given based on how well you accomplish three parameters: time, score and survivors collected) that will gate you off from later levels.

Unfortunately though, this release is still in a serious need of further updating. As the game is currently, it is nothing more than seriously frustrating and an annoyance.

2491976,245150,The Novelist,"The premise of this game is great and I couldn't wait to try it out. It succeeds in the sense that I found the conceit interesting (you're essentially a spirit, possessing objects and rifling through the family's things for clues about their goals in life), and it was fun to play through in a single sitting. I enjoyed the compromise system because it added a little weight to the game that otherwise would have been too simple.  That said the constrains of the gameplay system made it difficult for me to relate to the Kaplan family. Unfortunately it ended up making them all a bit unsympathetic. For example, I would think in a real family when the mother's relative passes away unexpectedly, your child wouldn't respond to a change in plans with a screaming and crying fit, especially not at ten years old. Also I didn't understand why Mom and Child couldn't leave Dad alone until his novel was done. The deadline is set and it will be a finite project, so stop asking him to play and all that until he's done! Or when you have the option of taking the kid to a fair, the mom on a trail hike, or dad to a campfire. The mom goes on the hike if you don't compromise with her, but she twists her ankle and isn't able to complete it. This makes her angry. It just felt way too codependent to me then, like go on the hike by yourself and enjoy it! Lastly, Dan giving up on writing after that just makes me feel like he wasn't serious enough about it in the first place.  Still a fun and interesting adventure remeniscient of the Stanley Parable but played much straighter.",1,0
2492027,245150,The Novelist,"As much as I hate to say, it has let me down a bit although I was not all disappointed. It still has some good things in the game.  The game length was terribly short. I finished the game at only close to 2 hours and buying this game at about $10 does not seem to be all that reasonable (That is the discounted price. The original was close to $20 in SGD) and the gameplay becomes repetitive: Find clues for each character's desires, make a decision, see the outcome and then repeat again. It gets more boring and despite attempts to make things slightly more exciting, it only gives way to 1 or 2 intense moments.  Despite that, the story line is extremely flexible. The story is right below, in the description. The rest of the story is pretty much in your own hands. Each decision will even make the character's thoughts or insights different and has the possibility of impacting the ending.   What it does good as well as that it is impossible to balance the time and sacrifice is a need. When you make a decision, you affect others in a bad way. It actually forces you to keep questioning if whatever the character is doing is so important and whether another event is more important than the other. You will find yourself spending time on one of them and yet all at the same time, forsaking relationships.  3.8/5 It's most unfortunate that the game's story cannot hold out the repetitiveness of the game and the length or it might have been better :/ Until the, get this game only at a discounted price. 75% discount would be better.",1,0

2498944,245280,ENSLAVED™: Odyssey to the West™ Premium Edition,"I'd had this game in mind for a while, and finally picked it up because it went on sale - absolutely worth it. I thoroughly enjoyed the story (always one of the top selling points for a game with me); it had great pacing and the spectacularly voiced characters were wrapped up in a sci-fi setting that doesn't get bogged down with exposition, sprinkled over with just the right measure of philosophical inquiry.  Gameplay-wise, I'd have to say the experience reminded me of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed - sans the excessively annoying boss QTEs and exhaustively long list of combo attack chains. Monkey's climbing sequences are scripted to oblivion, but I still found them fun. Trip manages to be a mostly competent tagalong, except for a thankfully small number of times when she must be thrown across a gap (good rule of thumb: always jump after her and mash the heck out of your 'interact' key). One personal irritation I had was the occasional limitation and snapping of the camera, which made orientation a bit of a headache.

2501544,245450,Wizardry 8,"Perhaps one of the best turn based games of all time. Wizardry 8 is, sadly, the last chapter in Sir Tech's long running Wizardry series.   I've played this game since it initially game out back in 2000, and I still regularly play it today which is a tribute to simply how good this game is. The quest resolves around some mysterious artifacts, an evil dark savant, and an awful lot of random encounters. The combat is turn based, with each of the characters in your party been able to perform actions on each round, which can vary from casting one of the many spells, to playing an instrument, or simply hacking away with your sword.   The spell casting system deserves a special mention; rather than simply having a fixed damage for each spell, they can be cast at a variety of power levels, with lower level spells been easier to cast at the higher levels (up to level seven). This help stop even your lowest level spells from becoming redundant for most of the game.  This game is however fairly hard, (through it is perhaps the easiest Wizardry game), and you will most likely have quite a few frustrating moments, save often because you never know what is round the next corner or whenever the rng will go your way.   All in all if you enjoy any type of turn based strategy games, and especially if you enjoy turn based RPG's then trust me but this game because you are missing out.  Still as great as ever.",1,0

2506291,245620,Tropico 5,This is such a better game than Tropico 4 which I though was impossible with the incredible campaign. They added a whole new level to Tropico by adding eras; this addition makes the game so much more in depth and challenging. I love the fact that they changed everything and added so much detail to the game it’s practically real. They changed the layout of the building and made the game more user friendly without taking away the difficulty of it. Also they added multiplayer which is awesome! You can play with your friends and make your own cities on one island. Everything they did blew me away and definitely worth the buy!,1,0

2508399,245620,Tropico 5,"I liked Tropico 3, bought Tropico 4 and LOVE it. I didn't think Kalypso/Haemimont could screw Tropico 5 up. They did. The game has far less content than Tropico 4 did on release day. This is so you can buy content later as DLC!  The economy controls are dumbed down. Rent, wages, and all other economic factors are frustratingly simplified and broad.   Shipping was a bit of an annoyance in Tropico 4, goods could stack at docks faster than it could be shipped. In Tropico 5, that has been remedied (sort of) but the new way of shipping goods is an annoying, island clogging, minutiae-filled chore that makes me long for T4's flawed but ultimately less annoying shipping system.  T4's troops worked automatically and you had no control over them. In T5, you do have control. A good thing, right? Wrong. The troops controls are clunky and unresponsive. Another chore, not fun.  Rebels in Tropico 4 would appear if you were doing things wrong or didn't have enough jobs. There was a reason (and cure) to having rebels on your island. In Tropico 5, you have rebels for no reason. Your island could be a perfect paradise, but huge rebel attacks will still occur. The Developers have admitted the rebels are arbitrary and for no reason other than some lame excuse about it being an upstart island with political turmoil; it just (and does, often) happens.  In Tropico 4, you could be a benevolent ruler, or a brutal Tyrant, which is what Tropico was all about. In Tropico 5, you are an impotent and weak governor that can only survive by doing your best in hopes of pleasing the fickle masses to desperately stay in power.  Then there is DLC. Tropico 4, when it came out, was quickly buried in DLC. BUT! The first several DLC were handy, useful DLC. The DLC had VERY useful buildings, cool decorator pieces, a mission, and outfit. Over time though, the Tropico 4 DLC became cheap, useless cash grabs. This crappy DLC content continued on into Tropico 5. All the DLC in Tropico 5 is pointless and adds nothing interesting. Not only that, but a few skilled gamers actually found large chunks and entirely complete, usuable DLC in the RELEASE DAY game files. Which the Devs tried to patch out and B.S. away.  In Hindsight, you could offer me Tropico 5 for free, and i'd decline the offer. Tropico 4 is superior in nearly every way. With Tropico 4 being available on Steam, there is absolutely no point, reason, or need to buy Tropico 5.  This really, for me, is a bummer. This isn't some game I saw, tried, and didn't like. I LOVE Tropico 4. I WANTED to see this game succeed. Kalypso/Haemimont are the little guys in the gaming industry. But when they got greedy and released a content-weak game and put that content (that isn't that great to begin with) in DLC, they sold their integrity to nickel-and-dime their customers.  I was dissapointed when Kalypso started rushing out several shoddy DLC at the end of Tropico 4's run. Now, with Tropico 5, Kalypso/Haemimont are no longer on my radar, I don't care about their games.  That's okay. I still have Tropico 4.   EDIT: Some people have posted below with some very good arguments about where my review may be wrong. I still feel my review stands, but if you are truly looking into whether you should spend your money on this game or not, it wouldn't hurt in reading the comments below for some very valid responses that may change your mind.",-1,1

2510148,246070,Hack 'n' Slash,"The first third of the game kinda feels like a thought experiment about merging RPGMaker software with a Zelda game. It has a true novelty to it in this respect. After that it quickly turns into understanding how an object works internally and advances even quicker to a point where you have to cope with strange abominations of actual program code (looks like Lua). Without programming knowledge or a guide you only get about 50% of the game. The novelty then begins to wear off and you kinda ask yourself why they even bothered adding coding since the initial mechanics worked so well.  I myself had to use a guide later on since even my considerable 10 years of coding experience didn't prepare me for how bad these puzzle can go. They are not even that complex, you just don't get what the game wants you to do. Later on you can seriously break the internals by accessing pretty much everything in the game world. That would be cool by itself, but it's really hard to decipher what was intented and what's simply a bug looking like ingame events.   That said, I kinda like what they did in the first half, but after that it pretty much goes downhill in terms of usability and understandability. If you like games for their ideas and concepts, it might be worthwhile. Though I recommend watching some of Double Fine's making of videos beforehand to get what this game attempts to achieve.",-1,0

Needless to say this game needs an extraordinary amount of work before I would even have classified it as Early Access. For now, stay away.

2512692,246090,Spacebase DF-9,"Even if you get DF-9 very cheap (like I did) and not expect a lot, you will be disappointed. It's kind of a space station sim alright, but 1.) the gameplay does not have any depth to it - hardly any resources to balance etc. 2.) it just feels bland and boring after a very short time, there are no goals / challenges 3.) it's bugged. not in a 'it crashes' way, but in a 'it constantly kills your space station with peculiar mechanics details' way.  What do I mean with that? 2 Examples: In the tutorial mission, I ordered the removal of a wall. Funny enough, the floor got removed as well (the difference between the 2 available remove/disintegrate commands was not explained', so I had a hull breach in the corridor. To fix that, one of my builders would have needed to use an airlock - which was on the other side of the corridor. Result: dead end, start a new station. On the new station, I build the most important new structures (generator room, oxygen source, airlock). Unfortunately, all 3 residents randomly ended up on the outside of the airlock, making it impossible to finish building it. Everybody suffocates. Or maybe the airlock did get finished, but failed to operate because all 3 tried to use it at the same time... I don't know, I will not try to find out. And I will not start a new game.  Funny thing is, from reading comments here, I now know that in the less than 2 hours tutorial play, I have already seen everything there is in this game. The only thing that would have been left for me is build the space station bigger with more of the same kinds of room. I thought I was too stupid to make proper use of the 'derelic vessel' parts, but it turns out it's because they are useless.  Well, time to move on.",-1,0

I know there's a cadre of programmers trying to take up the mantle that DoubleFine left behind to fix it via patches and mods, but the bottom line? They shouldn't have to.

2513012,246110,MASSIVE CHALICE,"Long story short, I would not recomend this game to somebody who is looking for a well thought out, strategic, and deep tactical video game. However, if you're looking for a simple game for cheap to get you INTO tactics games like XCOM and such, this might just be for you.  I think I can say that I was severely disappointed... I'm enjoying myself yes, but I expected a whole lot more from it. I was expecting XCOM mixed with Crusader Kings 2 and Fire Emblem. But what I got was a very, very, lifeless, casual game. It's overall minimilistic look keeps me from being immersed in the world and differentiating the characters from one another, they all just form together into one blocky, ps1 grafix mess. The strategy is simplistic and I have no idea what they were thinking with the action point system. Usually your turn is subject to move-move, move-attack, attack-move. But this game says move-move-attack, move-attack, or attack. Which I guess could be tactical, but it doesn't play out that way. The rules are in favor of the candensce... candesce... condesce??? I don't know big bad evil copy pasties.  I wanted a game where I could feel emotionally connected to my units, build up their heritage and watch them grow, but all I saw in them after couple hours were stats with faces attached. I barely cared when my characters died because one would always replace them instantaneusly. This could have been easily avoided had the game's timeline been shortened to let you get more in tune with the characters, and i don't know... CUSTOMIZATION??? I was so disappointed I couldn't customize the houses and sigils as well as name the characters. I know it was a kickstarter reward, but regardless, it's almost inexcusable to PURPOSEFULLY hinder your game to give more insentive for your backers... Also the chalice is annoying. At first it was quirky and interesting, but then the repeated lines made me irritated and kinda droning along.  Overall... if your a tactical strategy fan who wants a challenge focusing on strategy, pick up Crusader Kings 2, especially XCOM if you haven't. But if you haven't played turn based strategies, you want something simple and easy to pick up with a bit of difficulty, for the price it isn't really bad. A rather solid entry level game. But veterans? Give it a pass.",-1,1
2513334,246110,MASSIVE CHALICE,campaign feels drawn out. 'battles' are on boring simple maps with the same few enemy types but alot of them. which might be good but is just plain boring. researches give only vague descriptions of some items which end up being pointless or under sell others that help emensly. progression of heroes and bloodlines lead to higher stats like damage hp and acc. then enemies get reskined as advanced and get highr hp damage and dodge.... so just becomes the exact same boring slog as the mid game. you have to be exceptionally unlucky or stupid to screw up the early game.  also having an issue where the cadence increase in areas different to those shown before battles.  actually made it alittle funner. still super boring. feels like every second of those 300 years,-1,0

What I expected is a detective game with paranormal twist, like Murdered: Soul Suspect. Long story short, it is not even close and fails in almost every aspect. Usually I leae positive reviews, but this game is really poor.  The gameplay is really boring, almost every part of it feels like a filler, leaving nothing interesting or captivating in the end. The game consists of several 'activities':  1) Zombie shooter. It's very consolish (no wonder here), you walk around, shoot zombies in the head, collect weapons they sometimes drop and other items like coffee (any item is highlighted by bubbles visible a mile away). In certain rooms you can access your toolbox (an extra inventory, very gamey), save, sleep or change your suit (what for??? it's completely pointless).  2) QTE sequences. They are brutal. You have less than a second to press a needed button, and there are several in a row. How about mash A and D - Q - R - mouse left click - E? The only way to succed is to die several times before you learn the entire sequence beforehand.  3) Roaming around the town to get some quests that should earn you better weapons or some other stuff. Thankfully its optional because this is one of the most boring things I've ever saw in a game - bland town, bland streets, bland graphics. It's like a very poor attempt of a GTA clone. Another filler to extend the gameplay time IMHO. A side quest I completed consisted of finding a sports equipment lost in a police station for a police boss... fascinating!!! :)  4) Watch long cutscenes with conversations. They are really weird. All characters lines, models and animations are so bland I couldn't believe it. You get a cop which is like a dumbest cops from all police movies combined. You get a police chick obviously interested in protagonist. You get a farmer which is ye olde standard farmer, salt of the earth. There are two kawai small boys who are like angels. And there is a main protagonist - yep, he is FBI agent with paranormal abilities! This is so new, wow, how could they invented that???! The entire game is like they took a standard B movie characters from 100 poorest movies of all time and made them even simpler than they were. It's hard to explain, but the entire story and characters feels like a caricature.  So a typical story mission consists of speaking with your police buddies (with long pauses and poor animations), driving a car for 10 minutes through incredibly bland looking landscape, watching another conversation where you act like a cop from B movie (or maybe Z movie?) and your buddies act like actors from 4th grade school theatre, then going in alone (of course), navigating a dozen rooms shooting zombies and collecting pointless stuff, then facing a boss and dying multiple times in a row before you learn that QTE sequence (good dog!). After that, if you are lucky and the game didn't crash (happens with a fix as well sometimes) you watch another conversation and the day thankfully ends.  Incredibly bad and unfitting music adds the fun.  This is it. If there is a brilliant story, it is hidden too well under all this filler. I would think I don't like this game because I don't like Japanese games overall (they are too weird for me), but I enjoyed Murdered: Soul Suspect which is also a console Japanese game. This one is simply a poor game with no detective gameplay. Heck, there is hardly any gameplay at all.",-1,0

2553647,247730,Nether,"This game, as it currently stands, is a waste of time and money. The monsters are too damn easy to beat when you go one on one but one on five is a bit much. The amount of greifeing jerks on this game is enough to make you sick. The graphics look pretty and very nice but do not let them fool you into thinking that this game is anything like pictures and trailers that it has up. I honestly think that this game has great potential but it needs some drastic changes to its mechanics. Especially colission detection. Oh and not to mention, the leveling system and the scavaging system SUCKS beyond all reason. You die, you go to level 0. WHO THE HELL DOES THAT IN A GAME? The diversity to characters are crappy at best and if you really want to 'have fun' Then you are urged, like a money drone, to buy the game with the chosen or believer bonuses. Which in my opinion is a grand waste of money that could be spent on games that are being more thuroughly developed. This game feels old and clunky at times. Also, the skeletons and items you find in the game look bigger than any human being I have seen. It is stupid and needs to be fixed. Id recommend that the scavaging system be hammered out to being so much more specific and grandios. Like Rust or The Forest. Perhaps that would make the game that much better.",-1,0

The devs do put forth a great effort to stop hacking and cheats but not to griefing at all. And now the playnether website isn't even secure. So when you need to check your account or look for support, your biggest help turns out to be hackers who have figured out how to get around the many login issues and server glitches that keep you from playing.

2561134,247730,Nether,"By far the worst game I have ever bought. (Glad I only got it for $3.)  It's not very well optimized for a game with fairly simple graphics for today's time, especially with the fact that it only works on 64-bit systems. Definitely a lot better optimized than some other games, but it's got a ways to go in that regards.  It's also the buggiest game I have ever played, especially for a game that was in a semi-open beta for quite a while. The server list takes about 15 minutes to load before I can even move my mouse and actually join a server. When I do finally join a server, there's not really any tutorials on the various mechanics of the game, which would be fine if there weren't that many (and there really aren't that much), but supposedly there's things like weapon crafting, doing quests, and all sorts of stuff I couldn't seem to figure out. I approached a shop in a safezone and the nearly non-existant UI for the shops is insanely confusing, and it apparently started a quest with only a simple marker on the map, no marker in the actual game and no place in the UI to track quests at all (as far as I could see).  And then my game randomly crashed, and locked up my computer for a full 5 minutes before it finally let me end the process. I have never seen more bugs in a game where most of the bugs, especially the game-breaking bugs, should have been fixed by now with how long it was in beta/early access.

2562877,24780,SimCity 4 Deluxe,"Straight up classic. Was the premier title in its genre for over a decade until cities skylines came along, but it is still great.  My experience with the game is pre steam, and I still have the disk. Base gameplay is reasonably complex with a multitude of options, if some of the simulation is simplified becasuse of the technical limitations of its day. Has a dash of humor for good measure. Reasonable difficulty once you understand how the game works.  There are a few technical issues on newer operating systems, but fixes exist if you google for them.

The graphics style looks as if it belongs on the Megadrive but that adds to the charm for me.  The story is good and the characters are lovable.   Like Sonic, you can rush through levels or explore a bit. But the levels are quite long anyway so no 30 second stages. The music is also great.  You get infinite continues if you lose all lives so if like me you die a lot then you don't have to redo large parts again. This means it isn't in any way a hardcore platformer.

If a patch adds female dwarf models (and not just one or two; 50% of the models should be female) I'll revisit my review, until then I'm sticking with Terraria and Gnomoria.

2573798,24840,Medal of Honor: Airborne,So far MOHA is one of my least mosy favourite WW2 game. I love the concept and all of that however the game just doesn't fall through I don't know if its the terrible cover system compared to a game from 2004. The story I had no attachment to so I have decided to give up for now but the real problem with the game is how it feels like a arcade game thats trying to br realistic or at least thats how I felt.  I like the idea of it being free roam and being able to land in secret places in the map however if you just find were these locations are then all you have to do is jump and you get the award. here are many glitches like this in wich once I shot a enemy three times in the head and to my knowing it is not physically possible for a man to be hit it the head by a sniper rifle shot and continue to keep on killing other soldiers.  Again I loved the idea of this game but had it been done by a studio without a time limit to push out their game I think it would of been a much better game. Although the Call of Duty franchise has no substance anymore it would of been better had it been done by a Call of Duty studio when they did games not just about killing a generic terrorist every year or maybe by the team from Ubisoft who made brothers in arms then maybe it would be a game worth spending more then £2.00 on like I did.

It's simple and fun, a good game to open up now and again when you want to feel free from distractions. Run, jump, and run some more. I nearly got addicted, until I noticed something.  I just blazed through the game the first time, and I was eager to get as many stars as I could. Hunter mode came out. I simply had to play it, I couldn't stop myself. Then it happened.   I stopped dead in my tracks. As soon as I got through the first set of Hunter levels, I couldn't get any further. I had to pay 6000 credits to unlock the next area. Since then I've been stuck grinding, squeezing all the coins I can out of the levels I can't get 3 stars on. Nothing worked, I couldn't get my star level up, and I wasn't getting near enough coins to keep a steady rate to 6000. I honestly don't even know how this happened, but thankfully credits don't cost real money.  Nearly all my interest in this game just disappeared. One day I might come back to it, but until then, this game is dead to me. And In a way it's kind of my fault. Maybe you'll have better luck with this game.

No way to revive your team members when they die in both Single or Multi-Player. Also no way to exchange items from one Hero to another in Single or Multi-Player.,-1,1

But gradually I found myself investing more and more time into escaping the dungeons. I like the charming visuals, the heros are interesting and gameplay is fun. You have to use strategy to build an escape route towards the exit because when you collect the crystal the enemies come swarming, which is exciting and challenging.

2607906,249650,Blackguards,"Wow, it has been a long time since I played the old 'The Dark Eye' - Games. This game brought back some memories.  It has a nice atmosphere and is quite challenging. I really missed the roundbased RPGs, which is, for me atleast, revived in this. Sometimes you have to think ahead, sometimes you can just bully everybody down. Some fights are really stressful, while others are straightforward. The point is that almost no fight is like another one, each requires new tactics and strategies, atleast to a point. Of course you have your base tactics, which, in my case was a mostly ranged combat play style. But pure melee or multiple spellcasters sound interesting too. The good thing is that every character is can mostly do anything, aside the fact that only characters with magic potential can become wizards.  Another interesting thing for was the whole plot. Having played the other TDE games made it easy for me to fit into the world with its twelve gods, its mostly human based civilisation, with much prejudice against other races and of course its bright and wild country side, which makes this world a beautiful place. But the beauty in this is just a mask for all the darker happenings in this world.  All in all, if you love Roundbased Strategy, a good and detailed told story and funny, yet serious, characters, this game is for you. Just bring some time and patience, because the downside of this are the time consuming fights and the kinda missing background story of your secondary characters.",1,0
2608165,249650,Blackguards,"There might be a good game buried somewhere in here, but the initial few levels have bored the bejezus out of me so hard, it's tough to imagine how I would get to it. I like the hex based system that was implemented, but so many menus and tutorials are thrown at the player first off, this game comes across more as 'player-character manager' more than 'turn-based strategy RPG.' The combat from what I played after the first prison level went downhill fast and continued to turn me off from ever playing this game again.",-1,0

2612057,24980,Mass Effect 2 (2010),"In many ways, a significantly improved game than ME1.  Controls were much simpler, albeit, not in a bad way. Some may argue that the weapon customizing feature was watered down in ME2. But to be honest, it was much more concise and sensible.  Graphics also took a wide turn. It may be because I didn't mod it but in default, the aesthetics and visual quality provided eyegasm. Next, the storyline, once again, proved immersing. The fact that your decisions count could make it as if you're in control of a story, a feeling that you don't usually get in today's games other than TWD and most of Bioware's games.  There's also huge replay value since you can embark on the paragon/renegade course with either a male or female character. Take for consideration also the plethora of choices that you can decide throughout the whole game. If you loved ME1, KOTOR, Dragon Age, and the like, this game is a must.  I would also suggest those who adored TWD 1 and 2. ME2 may be more FPS-oriented, but the story is always the game-changer for me, no matter what the game genre is.",1,0

2619448,250180,METAL SLUG 3,"I use to come to a resturant about 4 or 5 years ago and beg my grandparents to give me change to play this game. I remember they would give me about a dollar fifty and i would blow it in three minutes asking for more.   I guess really what im trying to say is this game was always hard, the usual troupes of arcade 2D shooters is here. Hordes of enemies, rapid attack patterns, seemingly endless respawn points for enemies, and one shot deaths.  Needless to say unless you have a free to play arcade cabniet with this game in it, this is about the best port you can get. For the 8 dollars it can really bring you back if you played in the arcades or even if you played when at a resturant till your food came like I did.  The mind numbing nature of mashing your fire button (or if you wuss out of that challenge and use the autofire button like I did) can keep you sweating and weaving in and out of the insane rapid fire attack patterns this game loves to throw at you.  The veichles are amazing and a core staple of this game, from submarines to classic tanks to jetpacks and camels strapped with turrets. Its all here.   The variety of weapons is also really on point for the pace it tries to aim for (super sanic fast by the way) and although my only gripe with the weapon drop system is that all to often you will find yourself reciving a heavy machine gun compared to the insane rapid fire flamethrower or the zombie bombs which is by far my favorite weapon in the game and the most creative kind of weapon ive seen in terms of relation to the story (you fight through braindead zombies and might even earn yourself a micro uzi shooting monkey while you do so)!  Playing with a friend is also rewarding as most of the time you find your battling against each other just as much as giant mutant crabs or aliens found in the missions. Trying to take a heavy machine gun so you wont have to fire your dinky pistol is more thrilling when your racing to recieve from many of the identical twin prisoners you find scattered throughout your various landscapes, desert, dank and murky caves, and a harbor jsut to name a few.  All in all this is a great version of the game like previously mentioned and well worth it for nsotaliga or anyone looking for a fun arcade shooter they can sit down and play quick sessions of (each mission your sent on only last about ten minutes at most if you plow through it and dont die at every turn)  My rating of this port is a 9.5/10 with my only gripe being this games crutch on giving you a heavy machine gun and not keeping the weapons you can use in the levels to a wide variety. I assume this is done so you cant plow through levels with certain weapons and making them to easy, again this goes back to programers making the game superficially hard to eat your quarters but seeing as the only penalty on this verison is a point restart you really have nothing to worry about.With that being said it dosnt really hinder the game as a whole and is really just a personal gripe of mine.   9.5/10   Buy it if you have eight dollars lying around, you will get a blast from it guarented!

The longer answer is that this is a story that does take time to develop and has its slow parts (Ep1 and 2 move well, but Ep3 and Ep4 in particular feels mostly about moving characters into the right place, for example), but episode 5 is the exclaimation point that nails this, showing TTG has the mastery of this episodic format. The action sequences get much more enjoyable and poignant in the last chapter as well. It's also a story that would be interesting to see a follow up on (keeping in mind this is a prequel to the Fables books as written), with a great hook at the end to keep it going.",1,0

2626893,250320,The Wolf Among Us,"A quality game. Though it is a tad light on content (less than two hours per chapter) it reveals just enough about Fables to keep everything moving. The game is very defensive about this being made for 'mature' audiences. Below is a portion of the Q&amp;A from their website:  The Wolf Among Us is about fairytale characters and creatures? It’s for kids, right? Absolutely not. The Wolf Among Us, like the Fables comic books it’s based on is a mature experience. It is violent and gritty and deals with adult themes. These are not the characters and stories from sanitized animated movies; they’re bloody, sexy and have never been on the side of a child’s lunchbox.  Calm down TT, we get it. You want to be taken seriously. Will it help when some of the rough edges are smoothed? Of course. Until then, most players will take the game as it is. What is it? The first real step of the graphic novel that can create a stepping stone for other games. The Walking Dead is great, but it comes with the name. Stick it on most anything done half well and some money can be made. This shows that all the success wasn't just from the flash hit.

Note that I have nothing against games with 8bit or 16bit art styles, as I actually own several true 8 and 16 bit games.  1. Your character has two sprites, one as an idle sprite, one for walking. This means you will never know which way you are facing. 2. These graphics just seem lazy. The charm of 8bit is taking that limitation and making something beautiful out of it, not going HELLO LOOK AT ME IM SUCH A NOSTALGIA JUNKIE LOOK ITS 8BIT SEE SEE. That doesn't stop your game from looking like crap. Take an example of another game that uses an 8bit artstyle, the ever popular Shovel Knight. The difference between these two games is that one looks good, and actually has different sprites for which direction your character is facing, as well as the simple fact that it actually looks like a game from the time period it's trying to emulate. 3. Whenever you walk against walls, everything kind of jerks around and I have no idea why. 4. The music is like someone took a generic dubstep loop and gutted it of anything that might have made it good. 5. The game tries to be cool by breaking the fourth wall in really dumb ways. 6. User created dungeons are rarely a good idea. 7. Don't even bother walking under any sort of ceiling. The effect is not pleasant. 8. The first mandatory dungeon is a LOLcats reference. 9. There is no point to any NPC humor whatsoever. This lead to me skipping so much of their dialogue. 10. Stepping up onto another block makes the camera jerk around.

2686270,251130,Chroma Squad,"As soon as I played it I IMMEDIATELY knew this had to be the same team behind Knights of pen and paper.  If you are buying this expecting it to have some simulation elements or have strong RPG elements then immediately stay away from this game. This development team has sucked me in many times with the premises of their games but they never follow through with this premise.  I certainly would have loved a game about making my own Sentai series where my decisions determine not only how popular the show is with the combat being real tactical battles with impressive 'fakey' special effects with many of its comedic moments being just the sort of crud a studio would pull to save money. Yet that isn't how the game works.  Basically to understand the game you take the role of several stunt workers who have decided to make their own 'power ranger' type show. You achieve this by having random fights at which you are given goals that you must succeed, there is a story but the characters involved mostly speak entirely out of character at all times.  In fact that is probably my biggest gripe about the game's comedy is that it has absolutely no grounding. The game makes no attempt to even pretend like there is a show actually being recorded because characters almost never say their proper lines and cannot shut up for a moment about their own special effects or plotting. So some jokes, such as the characters not being able to transform because their costumes are in the cleaners out of show, fall completely flat because it never feels like this is interfering with the show because it just feels like a Larp. Another joke that falls flat is their constant references to their cheap teleportation effects, which would certainly be funny if they didn't constantly refer to it. The comedy could have been this game's saving grace, the nectar that would sustain me through the simplistic combat.  Outside of this the vast majority of the game's comedy are references. The majority of them are 'references for reference sake' rather then folding them seamlessly in the game's comedy.  What the game really boils down to is a tactical RPG nothing more and nothing less. The studio runs itself and your decisions are just buffs, you are not the one writing the plot, chosing the opponents, deciding on the scenes. Yet what is there is just the barest of a tactical RPG, in fact if they didn't give you the ludicrous goals at the start of every episode the entire game would be too easy.  Yet even in this there are some genuinely good ideas there. Viewership, which you will max a little too quickly, depends on how you fight. Boss monsters for example must be defeated by your finisher otherwise you get a stiff viewership penalty (for obvious reasons) and if you waste a finisher on a boss and don't defeat it? You also get a penalty. Yet even this can come off as forced when you cannot even transform until your viewership is high enough (what is this viewed live?) instead of just allowing the player to carefully contemplate whether taking a penelty is worth it.  These goals are usually things like 'defeat all enemies before hurting the boss' which are decent ones. Yet as you go on they become quite complex requiring you to carefully map out the field. The issue with these isn't that they are difficult, and they are, but that they are the only source of difficulty in this game.  You then collect crafting items from ordinary enemies which you can craft into weapons that are usually 'comedic' so expect a lot of 'Bucket helmets' and 'Tinfoil swords'. They have their own stats as well as randomized bonus stats based on how good the item is. These are equipped like everything else and to the game's credit all the items show up on your characters.  You can get studio upgrades and even marketing using the money you earn on each episode. Marketing for the most part effects the money and viewership of episodes for a small fee. You can also use your viewers to activate additional powers unlocked by that marketing campaign which can easily turn the tide in a fight from easy to rediculously easy. Studio upgrades amount to buffs and bonuses to shooting or to crafting as well as unlocking more items.  To shoot you are given a selection of fights you must do, and you will do all of them so don't worry, and then you get into a fight. That is what it amounts to. All the shoots are usually fights with usually the characters chiming in, out of character, about what this episode might be about (as said earlier they barely keep up appearances that they are actually shooting this show).  I think what this ultimately boils down to is that this game is a disapointment in every level. It wasn't the game I thought it was going to be. Yet when I tried to like the game, the game actively hurt itself. Its comedy is forced, its tactics bogged down and simplistic, and the game is as linear as heck!  For those who are going to buy this as a comedy game, I should state that the trailer for the game is much more funny then anything you are going to find in this game. So watch 30 minutes of an hour of a letsplay and base how 'funny' it is on that.  Get this on sale for 5 bucks! If I could get my money back I would in a heart beat. Also feel free to say this is unhelpful because this review is negative, especially you production crew.  -Edit: playing it a bit more, the 'acting in character' does improve but the comedy still falls flat. Mostly because the Out of character events rarely manifest in character.",-1,1

2691028,251290,The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky SC,"Four and a half years is a long time to wait for a game, I think, but it seems I haven't outgrown this game yet, despite I've outgrown most jRPGs (and most games) in general in this time period. And Trails SC keeps reminding me of why I loved jRPG the way I did, growing up with it and all.  It's pure sentimental, because when I finished downloading, I couldn't bring myself to press START despite obviously loving the previous installment. The last game's ending still impacted me even now, and Joshua and Estelle's love story is one of the few that I adore coming from a video game. But I also enjoyed as much, in this one, of Estelle finding Joshua, but more importantly, finding her own. She grew up a lot, I think, and she became one of the best female protag I've seen in a jRPG, period. She's funny, she's witty, she's sarcastic, she's strong yet vulnerable. I've never adored another female protag the way I adore her. The way Estelle grew up throughout the game is incredible.  The country of Liberl remains just as immersive, and despite exploring the same cities over again, it does not feel old. If anything, I feel a little relief, because the first time playing FC I had felt a little - overwhelmed - at certain towns where it almost feels too real - too many NPCs who are genuine interesting. (Do you remember the shoppe keeper in Rolent in the first game and his mother's quest to find him a girl he could marry? Spoiler alert, she is successful!)  Gameplay is a little slow at first, a little 'feature' of Legend of Heroes series, as far as I know, and the sidequests can be repetitive at times, but I genuinely enjoy it. I probably wouldn't in any other games, but as I said, Trails SC simply is too rewarding to anyone who goes above and beyond to explore. Excuse me that I really like going from one side of the region to another for a sidequest just to enjoy the few funny scenes between the characters at the end of it.  The music remains flawless. But has that ever been a question?  In any case, I certainly recommend this game.",1,0

They are wildly unintuitive, it seems no consideration was given to updating them for PC gamers.

It's also fairly lenghty, with 12 missions, ranging from easy to moderately difficult and there are a couple of new towers to keep you occupied as well. It's still a refreshing take on the tower defense genre.   Unlike the other Anomaly games there's no commander to control this time, though. You'll only control the vehicles. It actually works better and keeps you focused on taking the correct route. Things can get pretty hectic after all and it's good to be able to see what's happening without having to worry about your commander all the time.   Korea is another solid entry in the Anomaly franchise. If you liked the previous ones you'll like this one for sure.  [Rating: 76/100]",1,0

The freedom of movement within the island is quite enjoyable : will you keep trying this dungeon with tough enemies but greater rewards or will you come back to it once you've leveled up a bit ? The leveling, fighting and magic systems are okay but show their limits around the two thirds of the game. Once you've discovered most of the good stuff and figured out most spells, the game becomes really repetitive. The fact that the fights tend to pile up in the end made me wish the game was shorter, just so I'd be done with it.

2729251,252030,Valdis Story: Abyssal City,"A game with lovely visuals and outstanding soundtrack that is marred by some of the worst game design decisions I have ever seen. There is a difference between challenge and artificial difficulty and the issue that I seem to find the most glaring is already quite fixable in the game.   Basically the combat is built around comboing your enemies and continuing said combo with a Skill Cancel which breaks you out of your animation and acts as a sort of invulnerability to dodge or get behind your foe and allow you to resume your combo anew, unfortunately you have a limited amount of these cancels and for some reason when you are in combat you cannot regenerate them unless you are completely inactive in a fight. Even a character who can summon minions is penalized for them attacking an enemy by not being able to regenerate. This probably wouldn't even be an issue if you had an alternative way of being defensive but unless you build specificially for blocking and parrying, a non defensive build character will not be able to block strong physical or any magical attack whatsoever, so you're stuck taking damage from an attack that you might not be able to dodge if you are out of cancels and cannot block without eating some heavy damage because any sort of attack no matter how weak will send you into a stunned animation that every enemy in the game will take advantage of. You're not even allowed to break out of a stunlock like you should be able to until an almost arbitrary number of hits.  What's worse is that with these flaws is that the game expects you to be perfect with a ranking system in bossfights that at first seems pretty neat, until you release later on that perfect ranking is very heavily out of your favor. You're ranked on how fast you kill the boss, how well you attacked without taking hits and finally by not using any life potions or essentially never losing all your health. This is fine but you soon learn that bosses become damage sponges who love to prolong fights by either constantly running or even blocking your attacks midcombo, can easily stunlock you out of cancels in their usually cramped arenas that they take up a good chunk of, and in later game do high damage that you can hardly seem to mitigate so getting downed is probably likely if you're not aware of their patterns, if they even have any. Its just an amount of perfection required that seems outlandish even for people that love this sort of unforgiving 'challenge.'  I want to love this game but damn was the magic gone when I saw just how unenjoyable it was at times.",-1,1

2733890,252350,Double Dragon Neon,"Double Dragon: Neon is the latest installment in the long-running Double Dragon series. DD: Neon feels like a total reboot of the entire Double Dragon series, starting things over from scratch + then also taking it completely into its own direction. Paying homage to 1980's &amp; 1990's culture in video games, movies, music, and so forth - DD:N succeeds in being an outlandish, ridiculous, funny, fun &amp; often challenging brawler in the DD universe that especially fans of that era of brawlers should take on.  To begin with the basic DD premise, here's the story: Marion gets kidnapped by someone, so the Lee Brothers, Billy &amp; Jimmy, head off &amp; adventure out to find who took her, kick butt &amp; go rescue her. That is just the start of things, as the game that feels grounded as it begins and then eventually adventures into outlandish + ridiculous over-the-top territory, not feeling like many of the older Double Dragon games. Neon is constantly tossing out 80's + 90's references and paying homage to the classic games, movies, music &amp; things from that culture + era. This game is definitely not to be taken seriously - and thankfully, it fits b/c the game's just often really fun to actually play.   But, oh - can it also be challenging + frustrating, too. Multiple run-throughs of a level b/c of no auto-save placed in an entire level can be annoying + frustrating, feeling like a trip back to the 80's + 90's of difficult games from the Nintendo era. The game will save itself once you finish a level, though. So, you won't have to always restart from Level 1, if you need to leave the game + shut it off for a bit. And this all here was on its Normal difficulty (which is what you start with; you have to finish the game to unlock the others)!  Gameplay feels like your typical side-scrolling 2D-style brawler, for the most part. Of course, the game isn't without its own twists - by basically combining many classics brawlers + throwing some RPG upgrading-elements on top. If you've played classic fighters such as Streets of Rage series, Final Fight (some moves are just plain unrealistic + combat is faster than old Double Dragon) and especially Double Dragon (since it's still a bit methodical with its combat) - you basically know what you're getting into. Combat here just feels great with the X360 gamepad. While Neon is mostly a linear affair, like River City Ransom (NES), you may run into shops in-game where you can purchase upgrades for your skills + abilities. Constantly, you are defeating enemies + picking up power-ups for your skills (which are mixtapes + even have their own songs in the Inventory menu!).  If this all sounds good to you with gameplay + combat - well, you're in for a treat. Combat here is a lot of fun + a joy here to take part in, for the most part. Playing with the X360 controller, the controls felt very smooth + the game also ran very well, normally ranging from 55-60 frames per second on my PC (i7 950; 1 GB VRAM of GF GTX 560 Ti; 16 GB RAM; Win 7 64-bit) when set in a 1920x1080 resolution (1080p). The game sports a very nice artistic direction that just oozes cool for its 2D environments, while its 3D character models look also good. Don't expect a technical masterpiece here, this isn't Crysis - this game's all about its sweet art direction.  The music absolutely stands out here + sounds great, having that 80's &amp; 90's vibe. Whether it's an actual song they made + performed with lyrics, or a piece that sounds like it could've been in an 80's movie, or a complete remix of a classic tune from Double Dragon games - the music always fits the bill and sounds great. No doubt about it, the soundtrack here is just always fantastic.   The game is not long, by any means per playthrough. For my first run-through, playing solo, it took around 4-5 hours approximately. There are Leaderboards, so you can compare your run-throughs &amp; compete with other players online &amp; even your Friends. Also, you can go through the Co-Op locally or on the Internet via Steam, so you can play with your Friends. Also, once unlocked - there are multiple difficulties, so if you want more of a Challenge and want to compete on the Leaderboards, it's certainly there. This all certainly could help the replay value, if you actually like the game &amp; want to give it multiple run-throughs.  When it all comes down to it: DD:N is just a lot of fun, for the most part. It plays lots of homage to 80's + 90's culture, runs well, plays well, looks cool artistically, has a fantastic soundtrack &amp; delivers a really solid experience. While auto-saves locations are placed after each level, some might like this challenge &amp; feel that is reminiscant of games from an older era (Nintendo era). DD: Neon is quite good. Neon is often funny, outlandish, ridiculous, over-the-top &amp; a flat-out fun brawler that gamers, especially fans of this genre (of brawlers), just should not miss.  Final Grade = B-.",1,1

2737008,252450,StarDrive 2,"As someone who enjoyed playing StarDrive, I'd like to share my experience of playing Stardrive 2. So far (14.6h) I've been playing as Humans (with my own custom civ traits of course - they make a MAJOR difference in your gameplay experience) on Normal difficulty, huge system with 9 other civs, and I'm currently faced with enemies on both my northern and southern space borders. I'm also becoming quite chummy with some samurai space bears.   Now I've seen some complaints about Stardrive 2, and I have to admit my first few hours had a couple of complaints - mainly research and... well, I'll tell you what else when I get to it. Further into the game I found out how they downgraded the spy system, but let's get back to research. I was annoyed at how you could not research all the tech on the same tier, and then I encountered my first race. (I'd like to mention that I don't go exploring the entire galaxy, so I don't encounter multiple races before I'm ready to deal with them. That'd just be STUPID... Hmm was that too rude of me?) When I entered diplomacy with them, I was happily surprised to find out that you could trade the tech they had researched for whatever you feel like giving them. After encountering a few more civs, and by the time I met up with my favorite bear shogunate, I realized that unless you take diplomatic action towards these aliens, they're gonna wonder why they should keep the stupid foriegners around rather than kill and conquer them.  I should probably mention that being able to customize your ships relatively freely is a big plus for me. They made it a touch simpler than the original StarDrive, but while it was disappointing at first - I realized it cut down the time I spent designing my failures and designing new ships to replace the failures (since they sucked in combat) or redesigning my redundant ships (due to new tech). For example, in SD1 you could face all your weapon firing arcs forward. In SD2, the location of your weapon decides where it aims (except cannons/mass drivers - they always aim forward) The way around this though is to select the *arc extend* feature on the turrets you mount so they cover a 180* angle - aka they can fire forward.   I'll be updating this review in a few days once I'm back home and play a bit more, so I'll leave you with this: if you like customization and you find that you can understand a game's mechanics fairly quickly, then you'll enjoy this game.",1,1
2737968,252450,StarDrive 2,"Boo. I played SD1 and it had some interesting ideas but also had some big flaws that made it hard to enjoy playing for very long. There seemed to be some changes in this version so I tried it out. Long story short, while it has some nice bits the pieces do not fit together well at all. Some UI elements that you have to use every truen are tedious to access. Many turns, nothing happens. The AI is poor and only excells at massively cheating up units. I experienced multiple crashes and lock-ups in the later game and late game fights were slooooooooow. And this is a super minor thing but the background 'spaceship' sound effect is not controlled by the audio sliders in game, so I had to turn off all sound from the game to keep it from making my head hurt after a while.  The wrost part is some aspects are less good than the first one. Such as the ship combat and ship design, both of which I think are more simplified to the point that they are just busy work. The ground combat got an upgrade but it is still tedious.   I doubt I will play any more games of this. It was not expensive, but still not worth the time invested for a game that feels half baked.",-1,0

2825292,252950,Rocket League,"Rocket League is one of the most fun games I've ever played. The gameplay is soccer, played by controlling a car with a double jump and a rocket booster. The game is a sequel to a lesser-known game on the Playstation 3 called Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars. I played a ton of the first game, and this game improves upon it in almost every way. The only thing that is weaker in this game is that Rocket League currently does not have different types of arenas to play in. The developers have mentioned that they will release maps in the future that differ from the normal arenas. For example, the first game had a completely circular field with a tunnel on one side that served as the goal. These types of maps added to my enjoyment of the first game, but as I said, there are supposedly plans to bring them to this game as well. The paid DLC for Rocket League is supposed to be only cosmetic, and the map DLCs are supposed to come via free updates. This means you will not have to pay to be on a level playing field with others.  10/10",1,0

I love video games but the last time I remember having this kind of fun was playing NBA JAM at the arcades and then on home consoles (CRAP! I'm OLD!).  Support these guys folks. Buy the game. Buy the DLC packs that you like. Get your friends to play with you. You won't regret it.   Edit: 11/10   Edit 11/23/2016 - Over a year after release and I still play this game more than any other.

Tactics and good timing are key and if you do not have those I wouldn't suggest buying this game. Also, the game is BEST played with friends. There are 4 game mode; Duel (1v1) and 3 other game modes that consist of up to a 4v4 situation. Although these games slowly BREAKDOWN if you're not with a friend as everyone sprawls for the ball. My friend also ran into the problem where all the iteams he earned in the game got reset when he logged out causing him to have to grind games in order to earn them back.  Altogether this is a very polished game with a few bugs that need fixing. I feel this game is best played with friends so grab a buddy and lets PLAY BALL!",1,0

2830672,252950,Rocket League,"I'm still a bit of a beginner, but this is a very enjoyable game. There is a skill-curve, so don't get too disheartened until you've gotten a little practice.  You will need a stable, decent internet connection to enjoy this game properly, as single-player stops being challenging once you advance past a certain skill level. DLC is for aesthetic purposes only.  Multiplayer is the real draw for this game, as you can play with friends and/or other players on your servers. Don't be afraid to lose - most of your matches will be assigned according to a skill-based algorithm which goes up and down depending on how well you play. Therefore, statistically you WILL start to lose once you get matched against players in higher ranks than you. PLEASE consider this when you want to rage-quit whenever your team is losing. Just let the algorithm kick you back down until your skill improves.",1,0
2831420,252950,Rocket League,"Game is the stereotypical easy to pick up and play yet hard to master type. There's almost no learning curve. You'll be fine even if you never play sports games or driving games. Graphics are decent with a couple of different stages to play in. There's a wide selection of cars &amp; vehicle customizations for those who want to spend some extra time personalizing your vehicle. Paint color, paint finish, rims, exhaust fumes, decals, &amp; flags. There's quite a bit of customization freedom; albeit there'll all purely aesthetic. There's no option to customize the performance of each individual car. There's an option to play local coop as well as the standard online. The game is still very popular &amp; generally I didn't have to wait more than minute to find someone to play against online. The only negative aspect of online is there's still no penalty for rage-quiting. Frame-rate is steady; performance overal is very good across a number of different setups. This game runs well even on a potato. I tested it out on my i5 3470K GTX 970 build &amp; an older AMD Phenom II X4 955 Radeon 5770 &amp; both ran the game fine with no crashes or frame drops. It's a fantastically addicting game and I just can't recommend this game enough; It's the best sports game you never knew you wanted to play!",1,0

2834193,252950,Rocket League,"Rocket League is a very addictive game, It's an original, very fast, action packed game as well. I had doubts about buying the game myself, so here are a few pros and cons that might help you decide to buy the game. If you like cars and/or balls, you should already consider buying this game.  Pros:  - Noob friendly: you can start off by facing bots and there are some tutorials that are very good in my opinion - Controller friendly (in fact I highly recommend using a controller) - Awesome party game thanks to split screen! (very underrated!) - Car custumization: there is not a whole lot you can do, but you'll never see the same car twice and it's easy to unlock new stuff - Nice gamemodes (football, basketball, icehockey and experimental arenas) - Quickchat (examples are: 'Take the shot!, Sorry! and Defending...')  Cons: - Very toxic community, it's even worse than the GTA V online community in my opinion: expect to get rammed a lot by teammates who refuse to communicate using quickchat, and enemies taunting and spamming all the time. It's not even rare to face two goalkeepers in one match (which means scoring goals is nearly impossible). Don't get me wrong, there are some nice guys and girls out there, but they sadly are very rare. - Even the most difficult bots are pretty easy to defeat once you know what you're doing. However, you can increase the difficulty (offline only) by adding extra bots to the enemy team: you can face up to 4 bots on your own. - If you don't have any friends who own this game, you may get bored pretty fast. - Cross-play is still not available: yes, you can face PS4 players, but you cannot send them friend requests/invite them to play the game  I hope you find this information useful, feel free to ask questions in the comments and I'll try to answer them :)  Have a nice day!",1,0

2838209,252950,Rocket League,"Hello, before I bought Rocket League I was ofcourse reading on come Reviews and all the positive rating amazed me. I started playing it few weeks ago and the game seemed really fun (Rookie, Semi-Pro). Once I reached level 'Pro' I found big problem about the game. I will explain you my story now: So after reaching 'Pro' rank I started playing rankeds. While I was unranked I was getting 75% of the game matched up against people that are up to 25 levels higher than me (Veterans, Experts), I thought it was okay so I kept getting lose to them until I got my first rank, I thought after reaching my first rank I thought I would be getting matched up against people that are same, or simmilar skill than me. I was wrong, with my rank around Prospect Elite I was still getting matched up against people same rank as me, but HIGHER level than me, so that means they have more hours played &gt; better skill than me.  I think developers should edit Ranked Matchmaking System a bit, so it will only match up Rookie vs. Rookie, Semi-Pro vs. Semi-Pro, Pro vs. Pro, Veteran vs. Veteran and so on. With it being able to match you against Expert,Veteran or even higher it's just stupid. It really takes fun out of the game when you keep getting matched up against players that are much more skilled than you. My overall thoughts on the game are mixed, I still love the game, but It's really frustrating losing more than half of your matches because and keep getting matched up against players that are higher level than you, so they have more skill. I think you shouldn't buy the game if you get frustrated by losing undeservedly which everyone I think does. So just don't buy the game until developers do something about this '   Stupid    Matchmaking System' Have a nice day everyone!",-1,0

2850131,252950,Rocket League,"When my friend recommended a game that involved both football (soccer) and cars - two things I'm lukewarm about at best - I figured this game might be fun for a couple hours and then would be forgotten in the depths of my Steam library, like some artifact that an underpaid archaeologist might find amongst all the other garbage and waste. So, flash forward to 37 hours of gameplay at this posting, and...I was wrong.  I'm not in the habit of giving games 10/10 reviews. In fact, I can't think of a single game deserving of a 10/10 aside from those gilted by the mystical touch of nostalgia. The thing is, though, that Rocket League sets out to do one thing - one simple thing - and it does it perfectly. There are elements to the game that I find superfluous, like the add-on car bundles and different game modes (but I can avoid those). However, the physics of the ball and vehicles are top-notch and the multiplayer experience is absolutely spot on. Playing with friends is a blast, particularly when you come up against some whiner that decides that the best option when loosing 5 to 3 is to rage quit in the last 10 seconds. That's ace. Few games have such memorable moments of scoring ridiculous goals or making a crazy series of events transform into something unexpected and wonderful. It's the only game I've bothered saving a replay of, for instance.  Anyway, there are other things to be said, but if you need much more prodding, just think about the productive things you COULD be doing instead of playing this game and then be like me, procrastinate and tell yourself: 'just one more round'.",1,0

2876749,253030,Race The Sun,"Race The Sun is a game where every aspect of your experience will be pointing out to 'perfection'. It's difficult to describe my thoughts on it, and I also don't think it's necessary. This is a MUST OWN, it's really that simple. And then complexity comes, when you try to describe it. Let's start with the obvious.  You have your solar powered craft, the setting sun in the background and obstacles in front of you. When you complete a set of obstacles, you arrive at a new region, which will certainly be far more cruel and unforgiving that the previous. You have a variety of power- ups, the yellow beacon thingy is the most important one, since, and this is where the 'race the sun' part comes, the sun, as I said, is setting and your craft is solar powered. The yellow power- up will speed you up, prolonging your pathetic death, just long enough to see yourself plunge into an obstacle at an utterly insane speed, all because of your suddenly malfunctioning reflexes. But that's OK, you could always momrize the terrain and each obstacle, right? Nope. The people that made the game are actually so cool, that they are changing the game World every 24 hours. It may be similar to the World from yesterday, but it may be completely different. There is also a Portal World, which is also different every day. It may be a relaxing one, like, for example, observing a space battle. Or it may be one of those Portal Worlds that keep you on the edge of your seat, praying for a successful exit. They recently added a labyrinth mode, which is very fun to play and will really test your reflexes. The Sunrise DLC is absolutely worth buying.  In conclusion, you have a perfect gameplay, a real challenge, amazing soundtrack, new World every 24 hours, Leaderboards, ship customization and a loss of words, upon witnessing perfection.",1,0
2876882,253030,Race The Sun,"Race The Sun is based around the simple mechanic of dodging the elements to stay alive. I greatly underestimated the amount of fun I would have when I bought this. I wish there were a few more powerups or that there were more powerups in the levels as they make it really fun in a Mark Kart way where you pickup one powerup and use it.  Ultimately the play style feels a little like Star Fox 64 where your aircraft is on rails to some extent, which is perfect. 10/10 and even more so as I play on Linux with my Xbox 360 controller :)  A Simple Game Mechanic and Slam Dunked.",1,0

2883172,253330,Neverending Nightmares,"Neverending Nightmares is a psychological horror game from Infinitap Games. Let’s get rocking.  The Good  Firstly, two things in this game are top notch: the music and the atmosphere. Those are in order, by the way. Music edges out atmosphere for the top spot for reasons that I’ll talk more about in a second. But, seriously, the music in Neverending Nightmares is great. The menu music is creepy, the music in game is creepy, and don’t get me started on the use of bass. Spot on.  The artwork is reminiscent of an old Halloween book you might find at your parents’ place. It gives it a retro feel, but also a storybook feel with strong “You’re stuck in Hell for all eternity” overtones. A job well done.  The Bad  The atmosphere at the beginning of the game is phenomenal. Sadly, you can actually watch as the atmosphere plays as the story of the game becomes unintentionally disjointed and confusing and the gameplay itself becomes repetitive.  Whoever does the voice acting for the player character has the most annoyingly whiny voice I’ve heard in years. Every time he talks, you’ll want to beat him up and take his lunch money.  The Meh  The story, as I mentioned above, quickly becomes disjointed and damned near impossible to figure out what’s actually going on. Maybe that’s how the devs intended it to be, but I can’t understand how that’s possible.  You can “sprint” in manner of speaking. Your character starts to gasp and wheeze in less than a second. Whenever this guy wakes up, he needs to go see a doctor and get that ♥♥♥♥ handled.  There are multiple endings, but, the game gets so monotonous I doubt you could be bothered to play through it and see them all. One and done, I say.   Verdict: Nay  If you can get this game for next to nothing or free, sure, it’s worth a playthrough if only for how great the game starts out. If you’re planning on paying full price or anywhere near that for this game, don’t bother. There are better horror games for you to spend your money on.",-1,0
2883409,253330,Neverending Nightmares,"I feel like this game might have done better as a short animation. The art style is really interesting to look at and lends itself well to the creepy atmosphere. The pen style drawing look makes the world around you far more unsettling. The music and sound is a great compliment as well and there were plenty of times I found myself on edge just from the noises around me, even when there was nothing actually happening. The entire set up should have lent itself to a fantastic horror game except it's missing the game part.  There really was nothing to the gameplay here. Every so often you could look at a picture or the face of ever deteriorating dolls, but there wasn't much to interact with. Sometimes monsters would show up that you would have to avoid, but they were all pretty standard and as far as I could tell there was no real penalty for death if you screwed up. All of them were simple to figure out and were very easy to deal with making them very non threatening. There were one or two times the game did something interesting with each individual creature, but it only ever happened once and then never again.  Pretty much the meat of the game was walking slowly down hallways looking at artwork that you couldn't interact with. To make it worse a lot of the same visuals were used over and over and over again. The same creepy dolls the same creepy pictures the same unsettling blood splatters. What started out as unnerving quickly became dull and in some cases kind of funny because of how overused it was.  Finally the story was a little... meh. It was nothing special to begin with then add on to that the main characters seeming disinterest in everything going on around him just made the world feel even more lifeless. With the exception of some of the 'cutscenes' seperating the parts of the game you feel like you're controlling a paper doll. Dead body falling from the sky? Not a flinch. Seeing people hanging from the ceiling? Not even an eyetwitch. He just doesn't feel like a character let alone someone I should be concerned/interested in.  This game obviously had a lot of heart and love put into it. It shows in the style, the atmosphere, in the sound design and how smooth the gameplay is when it does happen. It unfortunatly just doesn't have enough to hold it up as a game and definatly not enough to justify the price of it.  I've only gotten one ending so far (the bad one I think) but I just don't think there was enough to keep me invested to try and get the other two. The first playthrough only took me 2 hours with me taking my time/looking hard at background scenery and out of that probably only about 20-30 min was spent on actual gameplay outside of walking forward.",-1,0
2883800,253330,Neverending Nightmares,"It's repetitive. Even though it is shorter than I expected, it still gets boring after 1 hour. Plus, it is sure that there is nothing scary about this game. Considering all of this, it is overpriced. Don't buy it unless there is a big sale.",-1,0
2884096,253370,Axis Game Factory's AGFPRO 3.0,"I'm not entirely sure who this program is designed for. It's basically a very simplified version of Unity, which lets you edit maps by deforming the terrain, and adding a limited number of assets.   You can then 'test' your map by playtesting the map using a variety of pre-build 'games'. For example... if you choose FPS player, you will spawn with a gun, life meter, and if you set zombie spawn points, there will be zombies that spawn that you can shoot. That's about it.... there's no custimization options regarding any of the game elements in this 'game factory'.   After building a few maps in this program, I felt extremely limited as to what I was able to create, and there's not much creativity when the assets provided are a few basic houses, some rocks, and some walls...   Judging by the trailers, I'm assuming this was meant as a beginner tool for children to design their first 'games', I personally thought it would be a fun way to design creative, and in-depth maps with a large number of provided assets, and then be able to design basic games to play with friends. (like RPG Maker) But sadly I was mistaken, and this program is mainly a 'tool' to help Unity game developers design maps more efficiently.",-1,0
2884503,253410,Ravensword: Shadowlands,"The game was promising at begining but later turned out to be a flop.   The controls for this game are ridicules. In mid fight if you hit 2xW or any other movement key you roll in that direction, so if you just wanted to flank an enemy or two of them you roll over and got delay (when you roll you need half a second to stand up and half to orient your self to see where you are facing) during witch enemys hit you hard like there is no tomorow.  The camera is the worst. You can chose to play first person but if you cary a shield you cant see half of the screen. If you play '3rd person' your charter is on far left side of the screen and it makes fighting hard. You need to predict where enemy will be to be able to hit the enemy. The description of items is laughable. There is none. No tutorial what so ever. Only on begining you get basic the movoment and camera setting.  Map is beyond bad. It is so confusing. If you press M and then press inventory the map disapears. If you press loot it disapears.  Way to many texture in game. You cant pass thru a giant gap in marketplaces to loot a chest.  The only good thing is lockpick. But even there there is no tutorial you just do it on a hunch, Similar to Skyrim.

2915971,255420,,"So, the game started off okay. I got a simple deck, which I understood. I figured I'd get more powerful cards along the way. But then by my third battle when I saw the caliber of cards that the AI got and the crap that I had in my deck, I didn't know how I was going to even get past the third game. Even after playing 5 or 6 games, I wasn't really getting anything good in the 'booster packs'. I have some pictures on my site that show me playing against the Hydra AI. He had 3 or 4 hydra's out and started stacking the counters on it. One of them ended up 130/130 with Trample. Even if I was able to kill them off quickly, he always managed to pull another from the deck. and I'm sitting there with a 1/1 fighter. GO FORTH AND CONQUER!!! I didn't buy any packs (which I'm assuming is their plan), but from what I read about the other reviews, isn't worth it.  Love the game, hate the program.

The graphics and UI are even a bit better than last years magic.  The New cards/decks, and greater deck building flexibility. Interesting story-related animations (which isn't worth much but a bit of a cherry on top)  TLDR the base version is a pay for demo, the complete version is a full game.

The only way to change your deck is building a new one, and that means playing over and over to unlock cards to build a FULL deck, and it takes ages. Also two-headed giant mode is not there anymore, and the menu is extremely slow.  I'm really disappointed about this game, I feel kind of bad to have wasted 10€. I hope you make this game great like your previous ones, and the first step in the right direction would be to make it that you can change your deck throughout the campaign, just like it was in the previous editions.

2928675,255710,Cities: Skylines,"Having written this review after the initial rush, I hope there will be room for both positive and negative views. At this point, I am well into the game and its myriad of mods and features. The obvious point of comparison remains the (somewhat failed) reboot of the SimCity, for better or for worse.  Both games remain focused on the RCI indicator, a series of bars indicating the rise and fall of demand for development of Residiential, Commercial, and Industrial zones. However, Cities: Skylines is at heart a traffic simulator, unsurprising when one considers the history of the software company. I believe that the original SimCity that came out when I was a kid was simularly a traffic simulator, in much the same way that another Maxis gem, SimTower, was an elevator simulator. However, players will notice that much more attention has been paid to the traffic simulation than to other areas of the game.  Where SimCity focused on a sense of 'progress' and 'rewards,' while always dangling the carrot of a destructive God-Mode, Cities: Skylines is much more laidback. If you want to destroy your city, you'll have more success taking the route of the insane mayor than the path of some prehistoric demon-lord. Cities:Skylines offers no insta-volcanoes, robot-attacks, or click-and-drag tornadoes -- instead, you could remove the sewage treatment from your city. Or remove the roads connecting your town with the outside world. Or destroy the power plant.  The effectiveness of such mundane 'disasters' showcases the strength of Cities: Skylines -- interconnectedness. The game is about the tiny changes that constantly occur, with or without your input. Whatever you did to fix that last problem will lie dormant for a week, or a month, or a year. But that quick-fix is going to come back, in a big way. For example: because you needed to increase the traffic capacity for your industrial zones, you built a hastily surveyed hiway connecting your city borders to your job-creators. Some years later, that well-meaning traffic fix is creating all kinds of havoc, keeping your trucks from using the lovely rail/super-hiway ring-system around your city.  And that's a problem more easily solved than most!",1,0

2932304,255710,Cities: Skylines,"I've always liked Tycoon kinda games. But it all started with Simcity 4 in the city building genre. Back then I was 8 so I didn't understand the mechanics that well but the idea of creating my own city was magical. When I was done with it I've played some Anno but it is a very different city builder and CitiesXL couldn't recapture the feeling I had with Simcity 4.  Then Simcity 2013 came out, it was trash.   Then this game came out, and I couldn't be more happy. This is what we needed. A true city builder with modern visuals and mechanics that allows you to make amazing cities that only get limited by your on creativity.  Pros  -The mechanics work very well and smooth. Laying roads and creating layouts can be done either super efficiently or very artistical.  -The ability to personalize your city with mods such as the terraform tool to create beautifull sceneries.  -You really get the feeling you build a metropolis. Your cities can be huge with elevated highways and the craziest intersections.  -The traffic in this game is really challenging which makes you constantly think about solutions on how to improve it.   - Steam workshop adds so much. Sharing buildings to make your city more pretty, intersections to help you solve traffic, maps to get a different experience for example building in mountains, and mods to help you to improve some gameplay aspects.  Cons:  -A.I can sometimes be a bit weird causing the traffic to be imo a bit too challenging at times. With the lane prioritization or not taking the most logical route but the quickest in distance.  Verdict: C.O has given the city building genre the boost it needed and with all the succes the games has had until now they can only make it even greater.  Buy this game if you like citybuilding kinda games.",1,0

2935740,255710,Cities: Skylines,"Always been a fan of city building games going back to the days of Ceasar and Simcity. I immensely enjoyed those games back in the day. I have put 1000's of hours into Simcity over the past years and it had its flaws, as any game. Playing Cities Skylines really added to the city building genre, it makes up for many things Simcity could not deliver. (Their last installment being the final nail in the coffin.) Cities Skylines adds more realism, real people and lifes, better budget systems and road networks. It feels more real, immersive. By far the greatest city building game in history to this date. One of the best games in general produced to this date. I wish the load on memory and graphics was a bit reduced, but I guess that is what it takes to make such a brilliant game. It is perhaps a learning curve at the start and for some rather complex, getting to sort your road network out can be a chore if you are new, but hang in there, read up and learn. There is a reason that people go to university to design road networks. I definately recommend this game!",1,0

2936982,255710,Cities: Skylines,"EDIT: Added screenshots to my profile which show performance and hardware usage  -PC Components- CPU - 6700K @ 4.5 ghz RAM - 16GB DDR4 GPU - 2x980 Ti  -Game settings- All minimum 1080p  -Performance in a city with about 30k population- (Los Santos from GTA V - Workshop map) 30-52 FPS when zooming close or medium range around the city. Also the game stutters quite frequently and I get sever FPS drops when moving around even while zoomed out.  Changing the settings to max only decreases the FPS with about 10-20 FPS. Lowest I saw with this was 19 FPS. Only  -Hardware usage- CPU - One core peaked once at 82% but otherwise all cores peak at around 70% most of the time they fluctuate between 60-40% usage GPU - Way below 40% VRAM - Below 2400 MB VRAM at max settings - Below 4300 MB RAM - Max 9 GB with a lot of programs open on the background  -Conclusion- The game itself is great and deserves a thumbs up, but this kind of performance is just unacceptable. With these settings the game looks like its from 2008 and runs like a limp dog ported from console by Rocksteady Studios.  I have tried all solutions which I found: reinstalled multiple times, installed on SSD, set CPU priority to the highest, verified game cache, disabled all other background programs, (EDIT forgot tomention SLI is disabled) and so on. Almost all of my playtime is spent trying to test and fix the issue.  PS: If you got any other solutions please share them with me, but otherwise I don't care how well it runs on your rig.

2939494,256190,Enemy Front,"I have been waiting, like many of us for a historic FPS since world at war and many medal of honor games. Really tired of all the futuristic, made up stuff.   I haven't played much but it is a really good game. AI is a lil weird but its AI. Have fun with it. Sure its a little buggy but it coukd be something if they actually care and not using it for money. For 23 dollars, its not bad. It does not crash on me. The guns are good but with some problems. i enjoy a good WW2 game. Even if it does remind me of sniper ghost warrior, a horrible game.  This game is not a 10/10. it could be though, easily. Right now for me, i would give it a 7/10. Only becayse i havnt played long",1,0
2939590,256190,Enemy Front,"TL:DR - If you have ever played another FPS game then you don't need to play this.  Ok so since a lot of people are rating this down I figure I'll go into more detail (not that it really matters but it is what it is).  WW2 shooters are not exactly hard to come by - I'm sure you can think of five or six just off the top of your head right now, maybe even good ones. This game plays basically like a mix of COD: WAW and Sniper Elite 2. You can throw rocks and stuff to distract nazis and use sounds to cover your shots like sniper elite. The combat, story, and multiplayer easily get boring, like Call Of Duty. So yeah, I personally don't feel there is any real unique selling point to this game, or any real reason to buy this unless you REALLY can't get enough of WW2 shooters. If thats the case go for it, and I hope you have fun.  But, just one last point for consideration: At the time of writing I have nearly 2000 games in my Steam account. I bought this game in the 2016 summer sale at 90% off for £2.99 (about $5 US) and I put it up for a steam refund. Feel about that however you want, but at least consider it.",-1,1

2942906,256290,Child of Light,"An enjoyable game that uses JRPG game mechanics to bring you through a fairly traditional fairy tale. Visually stunning, the story is quite well thought out, and the game's mechanics are workable.  While the continual rhyming of characters may get on some people's nerves, the game is rather short (~20hrs) so even if you dislike the rhyming you don't have to suffer with it for long. Given the setting of the game, the rhyming fits well with the subject matter, even if it's fallen out of favor since the 1800s.   Given that shortness though I don't believe anyone should buy this game at full price, but when it's on sale it certainly is a pleasant distraction for anyone who enjoys JRPG adventure games (or even just wants to find out what a JRPG adventure game is).",1,0
2943786,256290,Child of Light,"This REALLY is that time you want a 'MAYBE' option - I'm going with 'Not Recommended' because of just 1 aspect of the game but it's an important one I think.  The combat is awful - truly and utterly awful. It's killing the game for me - I'm actively avoiding it as much as I can but sooner or later you have to do it and it's just so BORING.  Enemies have no health bars so you've little idea what's going on without staring at flying damage numbers/messages to judge efficacy. The timing system gets truly unfollowable once there are multiple players on either side and specials etc. are scarce and often ineffective.  Worst thing is it just doesn't fit the rest of the game at all - it's a curiously static and lifeless thing in a game otherwise packed with joy and sparkle.  Everything else is fine - story, graphics, sound, controls are work well (the rhyming gets a bit grating but you can skip it without losing the jist of what's going on) but the combat isn't easily avoided - you'll probably spend more time doing it than anything else - and it really is tiresome.

2948431,257510,The Talos Principle,"My favorite game by far in 2014 (and in the last couple years, probably), was The Talos Principle. It was as if this game was specifically made for me.   The most important things for me in single player games are:  - the quality and inventiveness of the mechanics—and whether or not I can manipulate them in a meaningful way - immersion (which usually means first-person perspective, excellent sound design, etc..), - the writing/story  Regarding mechanics, combat-focused games are the majority in the industry—especially on PC and especially in first-person games—so those that aren’t centered on combat often must work more creatively to be interesting—games like Myst (1993) and Portal (2007). This is also true of games which have combat, but also offer non-combative methods to play through the game (stealth/sneaking, for example)—ie., Deus Ex (2000), Splinter Cell (2002), and Dishonored (2012). These are my favorite types of games—especially the latter, perhaps because the avoidance of combat adds a further complication to the mechanics of gameplay. So, I was really excited about the First Person Puzzle design of Talos when I played the demo at PAX Prime 2014. It was love at first sight in the demo booth. I had trouble getting through the last couple demo levels on my first try, but it was still extremely satisfying and fun. As I sat struggling with the connectors and fans and boxes, of the fellows from Croteam warned me the Enforcers were coming to run everyone out of the Indie Megabooth, but told me to come back the next day to finish the demo—they’d get me back where I’d left off. So I went back the next morning, finished the demo, and gushed to Croteam about how interesting I found the game and how excited I was to play it on release. I tried to explain that it reminded me of playing Deus Ex and System Shock 2. It’s hard to articulate exactly how Talos relates to these types of games, but they all give me the same kind of satisfaction upon completing an area, even if the mechanics and design are quite different—the end feeling as a player is similar, so there’s some kind of overlap in how the gameplay works on the player. And the first-person immersion helps with that. (I should note here that you can play the game in third-person and easily switch between first- and third-person. I simply prefer first.)   More on gameplay: the puzzles were great. I found the most satisfying bits to be finding the optional stars because I had to find ways to “break” the game (or at least The Great Voice in the Sky’s intentions… hehe) to get them. The puzzles in general—sigils, stars, and easter eggs—had that kind of excellent satisfaction to them—some of them were teaching the player the possibility of the mechanics, while others encouraged the player to break beyond the narrow way in which puzzle/first-person mechanics usually work. As I mentioned, in some ways Talos really reminded me of experiences playing the original Deus Ex and System Shock 2; there were ways to play those games that literally did break them, just because of the limitations of game development/AI functionality at the time. That’s not to mention that they had multiple routes to play the levels built in already. Talos also achieved the same type of feeling that the Half-Life games produce where it feels like you’re breaking the game—pulling one over on the level designers and outsmarting the game—but in reality that is because levels were designed so well. They were built in a way to teach you to break the limitations and expectations of regular gameplay. I remember the first time I got stuck in Half-Life and after I searched every possible route out of the area, realizing I could climb on the pipes to escape where I was—like, I was so shocked that there was platforming in my FPS! I remember feeling as if I was outsmarting the game, but looking back, of course there really was no other way to get out of the level. Yet it was built in a way that made that fact satisfying instead of frustrating.  Another thing worth mentioning: the QR codes. Without saying much, there is functionality built into the game to leave messages on the walls for other players (people on your Steam friends list) to see later. It might seem like a small thing—but it really was a great little touch and made the game even more immersive.  So I was super hyped for Talos’s gameplay, and it still delivered beyond my expectations. But I gotta say that the writing and storyline was on the same level, in really impressive ways. It was subtle but powerful, and—without saying too much—I liked how it played with the ideas of free will and game-imposed confines of “choice”. I guess what I mean is, the game—mechanics-wise—were already top notch quality and impressive. But the story—the character development through audio logs, the slow revelation of the story through classical literature and other text artifacts, the QR codes, the interactions with the terminals—made it even richer. Basically Talos combined all of my favorite aspects about video games in a really fresh, great way. And it also took advantage of some of the best avenues that science fiction opens up for those ever-important literary questions... “What is the world like, and what does it mean to be human in that world?” Despite the rambling nature of this post, I actually double majored in Literature and History at university. So this game just... I feel like this game was made for me. And I was made to play it! (All that said—if you’re not interested in story, you can completely ignore and not investigate any of that and still enjoy the game for its excellent mechanics. But I’d still recommend getting into the story!)   All in all, I recommend it 100%. Well designed, highly polished, and super cool devs!",1,1

I'm glad there are various checkpoints throughout the levels, since they are relatively long.  The game consists of four worlds with five levels and a boss fight in each world. The environments, enemies, and music are all unique to each world. I have to say that I loved the soundtrack.

2959556,258010,Ring Runner: Flight of the Sages,"I can't believe it took me so long to discover this game... In a Steam sale at that.  Personally, I'm a big fan of space shooters, but unfortunately the market is flooded with cheap ripoffs, mobile games, etc (with plenty of exceptions both new and old). Sure this is a late review, and most of my hours don't show up on here... But I've played it a-plenty offline for the year I've owned it  ~~~~~~Here we go for more detail~~~~~~~  PROS-  -Graphics are pretty good; as well as the interface, menu, and settings being very thorough and informative  -Story is surprisingly well-done, character development very clean and endearing, and even breathes a bit more life into the game  -Gameplay is like your typical arcade shooter.... on a LOT of steroids. You've got guns, you've got missiles, you've got teleportation, special abilities.... GAHHH SO MUCH! And it's actually a dang good challenge! Took me a day or two to even get the hang of the controls, much less the combat itself... You'll be shaking, you'll be screaming, and your blood will be pumping hard in some of these battles, trust me.  -Tutorial is..... I can't even figure out where to begin. It's stunning. They go through every little detail of the system, and at a very safe pace that works VERY well with the story, paces itself accordingly, but still manages to make things interesting.  -Shop and customization.... It's ridiculous. Ship appearances are not capable of being customized, but things like weapons, shields, armor, engines, etc has nearly limitless possibilities. The paid research is also helpful if you're slower to gather Plex (in-game currency). Keep in mind it only stacks to 10 consecutive segments of research if you don't play for a while ;) MAKE SURE YOU WORK ON YOUR SHIP IN THE HANGER, YOU WILL OTHERWISE HAVE A HELLISH TIME!!! (also, you can create and upload ship templates to the Steam Workshop)  -The ships themselves.... GLORIOUS. The design is very appealing, and there's even a class system of sorts for them. THat's right, a CLASS system. I won't spoil anything here, but let's just say its not so simple as 'fighter, bomber, stealth', there's way more to it that is very well fleshed out  -Multiplayer is pretty cool... though sadly not many play it anymore. Fortunately the bots for playing the maps yourself are pretty dang good (did I forget to mention the ASTOUNDINGLY good AI?)  -Story is actually quite compelling, and overall pretty kid-friendly (if you're looking for milder sorts of things), and every level is well-tailored to each chapter. Is it repetitive? A little bit at times, but what did you expect from a space-shooter? Some things like the lore and different species could've used some more fleshing out... But it's an indie so that's forgivable. Oh, there's also plenty of good philosophical goodies hidden here and there.  -Music....... brilliant. Not the best, but very fitting for the game and definitely wouldn't mind having it as ambient music, especially the chill little tune that plays in the hangar.  CONS-  -This game's controls are..... Well they're not for the fainthearted. While well-organized and highly customizable, there's a lot to keep track of. You will really HAVE to think, strategize, and set things up according to what you think will suit you. Get used to crashing a lot in the beginning... You'll get the hang of it. (I recommend trying out using an XBox controller, it's a bit easier for some)  -Multiplayer is practically a ghost town (much like Metal Drift.. another forgotten gem), and the community has gone practically dead-silent  -Even on easy, and with it's gentle learning curve, this game isn't really a good choice for newbs to this type of game. That is... Unless you're very gifted at adapting to new games, because this gets REALLY hard REALLY fast near the end of the campaign.  -You have to make sure you manually set a save FROM THE BEGINNING to save to the cloud. Otherwise you will lose all your progress and ships like I did when I uninstalled it for a while.  -Dev team has practically abandoned the game... But its no surprise given it's an Indie (a damn good one at that)  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Overall, overwhelming good points and a few bad, I give this game a 9/10 and strongly recommend it to anyone who loves this genre like I do and wants a meatier game to play in it. Or if you just want a fun and unique experience with this quirky little diamond.  Hopefully this game gets a new wave of attention in the future... Here's to hoping!",1,1
2960006,258030,,"Earthlock is a nice little gem of a game. I'm quite happy I purchased it and it was well worth the money. I'm hoping for a follow-up game from the devs with better writing. However, when you have 7 other languages to translate it into I understand.  Pros: -Graphics - are nice and colorful but can also change as you progress in the game to be dark and dense nicely matching the place you are currently going. The diversity is great and the maps are littered with beautiful vistas. Seeing the battles and the artwork were the main draws to the game for me.  -Battles and Fights - are really quite fun and every character has two stances. Some characters might focus on buffing and damage which others focus on healing and damage and others have a melle and ranged stance. It's quite nice and you'll find yourself switching in and out of stances at times to get the best results. You don't have magic either you have a number of amri (abilitiy points) that you can use and some moves require more than others. It's fairly wel balanced and tweaking the talents and bonds system allows for more customization.  -Leveling up system/talents/bonds - Leveling up does make a difference but something else that is quite cool is the bond system. Every character can bond with another. The point of doing this, outside of adding 3 unique points to your talent board is that it will grant the characters more unique abilities that when they are paired can make them stronger. This comes in handy when fighting certain bosses. On most fights you don't need to tap into these abilities but it's worth it when you fight difficult bosses. If you outlevel the bosses they can be easy but if not considering how to fight can be quite fun and worth your time. If you take the wrong character combos and don't consider what you need to win you will die in battle.  -Music - The compositions and score are quite nice. I had a great time listening to the music and never wanted to turn it off. Of course battle music may wear on you after awhile but I still enjoyed it. The sound effects aren't brillant but they're decent and they worked and were never immersion breaking.  -Languages - Lots of support for other languages in an RPG is hard to find. If you want to pratice another language or learn one it's not a bad idea to open the options menu and have it switch over. You don't need to restart the game and it works like a charm. I tested it with Chinese, since I'm learning Chinese and it was fast and easy. It's something most people won't care about but it's quite nice!  -Fun Factor - I always felt like I wanted to play the game. It rarely ever felt too grindy or like a chore. I wanted to progress and explore and kill all of the bosses. Dungeons weren't too long and the game was just a blast to play through.  Cons: -Storyline - It's not brillant. It's not awful but... being a veteran to many rpgs I was rather dissapointed with quite a bit of the dialogue. One of the characters who arguably does draw/stretch out the lore is often told to zip it. While this makes sense it would have been nice to find ways for the characters to ask questions as opposed to just ask him to shut up most of the time. They character dialogue when they spoke to each other wasn't interesting either. They didn't really say anything witty or clever most of the time. There were a few jokes but they didn't do it for me. If you want a wonderful story you will be a bit crestfallen.   Minor Annoyances: -There are 2 characters who did not have an animation when they finished two sections of the game that are required. It just seemed off though since I started grining this to level up my bonds/abilities.  -Garden Growing - Early in the game you are taken to a garden section where you grow plants to get the best items for two characters as well as healing items. This section can be quite fun but it is also grindy and you HAVE to do this for the best attack items for 2 of the characters in the game. I said this earlier and didn't mind it much but it might bother other players.  -Teleportation is nice but there to teleport anywhere you first have to teleport to a main hub. It's not a huge deal breaker but it will take you about 15 extra seconds to do this and you may do it a fair amount of times.  -No weapons/armor to upgrade. I personally don't mind but if you love equipping new gear you will be a bit upset.

2963649,258520,The Vanishing of Ethan Carter,"This game is simply breathtaking.  Once you have loaded it up and start the game, you get pulled into the world. Its almost as if the way real life looks and feels, is not the way it should. I felt as if I was in that world, the beauty and the pleasure you get from walking around in this world, just blew my mind. The look and feel you get from this world sucks you in, you want to look at everything, you want to look whats over there.  The thing I enjoyed the most about this game, is that it does not help you and tell you where to go. You start, and thats that. This is why I think the game is so amazing, it's not a situation where you are told go do this, or get that. You just explore and discover things for yourself. There no feeling of 'ah now I HAVE to go do this' and as a result you want to discover and explore.  I dont want to post any spoilers, so all I will say is I was a bit dissapointed with how the game ends, not the story or the way it ends, just that it ends and I was left without closure in the sense of finishing a game, again not the story or the way it ends.

2965276,258520,The Vanishing of Ethan Carter,"This is an amazing, gorgeous, thought-provoking game through and through. Some people have derided this as a 'walking simulator', but that's only partially accurate as in there are many things that you don't need to find or experience in order to reach the end of the game. As such, it's only a 'walking simulator' if you play it that way.  Although the game was designed to be a 'no holding your hand' type of game, this is both a benefit and a drawback. Not knowing what was going on led me to completely walk past two of the optional story pieces and almost past a third until I decided to watch one of the developers' videos. Only then did I realize that those things that I briefly looked at were actually puzzles that needed to be 'solved'. Again, they're not mandatory, but it still left me with a 'well, you could have at least told me about the first one' feeling. That, however, goes against the 'no hand holding' implementation.  The main reason for the game is the story, which was fascinating to watch as it unfolded. It never fully explained what was going on and even the ending leaves room for some interpretation, but it kept me roped in with wanting to know what was going on. One section with jump scares that required stealth in order to stay away from a 'ghost miner' felt very clichéd, but that was the only real negative with respect to content. Coming in at only a few hours, I found the story to be engaging and the comments about 'walking simulator' to be slightly disingenuous.  Additionally, this game looks GORGEOUS in stereoscopic 3D. (Water effects should be disabled, though.) The game is drawn in such a way that there is plenty of 'in front of the screen' action, particuarly when walking through forests and especially when walking through the flower-covered glade near the end of the game. These section come alive in ways rarely experienced when played in 3D. If you have an NVIDIA card, I highly recommend turning 3D on when playing this. Just be careful of those jump scares, because the 3D is effective!  It's a short game, but it's gorgeous and it's well worth the time as long as you can appreciate story over gameplay. You will likely be thinking about the ending for many days after playing it.",1,0

Thought I'd seen everything but had missed quite a bit.

2971478,258970,Gauntlet™ ,"This game is good, but with a few improvements it could have been great.   The biggest issue seems to be a terrible lack of content, the game can be completed in just a few hours if you really stretch it and take your time. The problem is the lack of levels, there are 3 types of arenas each with 3 floors and a boss floor, this gives you just 9 levels and 3 boss fights. This issue was sort of addressed in the last update adding a colosseum mode where you can battle waves of enemies for new rewards. They also added a new character which cost 5$ to unlock, now this seems like a slap in the face, that's 1/4 of the games price for an extra character. For a game with such a small amount of cntent it should have been free but I could have justified paying 1-2$ for it but not 5$.   Cons aside this game does provide a good time especially if you have friends to play it with. This game is all about co-op, it even has couch co-op which was a huge plus for me. Each character has unique abilities and masteries which makes playing as each character fun and different in some way. The masteries for each character are what give this game it's replayability factor. Completing the masteries make your character stronger which make earning the rewards from higher difficulties that much easier.   If your expecting something like Gauntlet Legacy you will be disappointed, but if your looking for a classic arcade style Gauntlet to play with friends then this is the game for you. I personally don't think that it's worth the 20$ price tag, so I would recommend waiting for a sale.",1,0

The different vampire clans you can play as provide plenty of replayability, and I've played through this game more times than I can count. In particular, Malkavians and Nosferatu make for the most unique experience.  The base game is a bit buggy, so track down the latest version of the unofficial patch before you get started.

2994467,260210,Assassin's Creed Liberation,"EDIT: Nominated for 'Nobody Gives A Damn' Award  My first review on Steam is actually a ramble.  I bought this game mainly to complete the collection. It turns out to be the worst I've EVER played.  It's a port from PS Vita; really obvious from the monotonous music.  The first thing that frustrates me is the controls. Aveline, though slimmer than her male counterparts, is much more clumsier. Freerunning through the trees in the Bayou is a pain. Somehow the system can't detect another branch on the other side of the trunk unless you press left or right. The leaves can be hard like walls and nothing can get through. Some of the gaps can be slid under while other gaps, much higher, are simply see-through walls.  Another really annoying thing about the game is the environment sounds and Aveline's sounds. Everytime she hops, or just getting onto a barrel, she grunts or groans. Freerunning through rooftops comes with a series of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ from her. The most irritating sound in the game is the questioning 'enh?' from the passerbys. In the end I just stab them when they issue such a sound.  The dialogue in this game is really illogical. No wait, they're ILL-logical. Take, for example, sequence 3. Aveline and Elise both crashed through the fort and 'wrecked' the slaves' 'chance for work' (more likely to be sold). But somehow the slaves had grudge only on Aveline, and Elise is able to take the slaves back, not to mention giving Aveline a sarcastic sneer of her 'incurring gratitude' when she herself had a hand in this. The mentor Agate questions Aveline's loyalty when she came to him instantly upon receiving his message, and then he stole her idea to assassin the governor and gave her an order that apparently she was going to carry out, regardless the order.  The quests themselves are just unreasonably difficult. Guards can detect you with their backs to you. Cutscenes are long, boring and unskippable, and the checkpoints are scarce. Don't even hope for the fast-travel: the 'fast-travels' marked on the map means 'ship from New Orleans to the Bayou'.  The innovative aspect of this game is the personas. BUT don't get you hopes high about changing persona whenever you want in the quest - impossible.  Don't waste your money on this. This is even worse than AC3. The only game in the series worse than this is AC3 DLCs.",-1,0
2994799,260210,Assassin's Creed Liberation,"I have to admit, that I like Assassin's Creed series and enjoy each AC game. The same was with Liberation, which is not a 'normal' game as e.g. Black Flag, but a port of a PSP's version. However I have enjoyed the time spent with Aveline. Liberation offers the same as the other games, but everything is just smaller. There are the same pros and cons as in other AC games. It offers us canonical for series: story similar to the previous ones; impressive fights, parkour great as always. There are also three different locations, which I prefered more than the ones in ACIII. On the other hand we find here a very stupid ending, sporadic camera problems and a few frustrating missions. Also the visual side of this game could be better - it is clearly seen, that the game was not made to work on the powerful computers.  The items collectors will also have fun - there are many chests to be looted and diary pages or alligator eggs to be found. The game is smaller by all means. You should include the time needed to complete it - it took me 6,5 hours to complete 86% of Liberation (including the items, mini missions etc). I recommend this game as much as I recommend any other AC game. Even if it is not perfect, it still makes fun and does not cost a fortune.",1,0
2994841,260210,Assassin's Creed Liberation,"What we have here is a failure to communicate... with the simulation timer.  The story in Assassin's Creed: Liberation HD is incredible, I honestly don't understand how they started it off at such a low price originally. The persona (character) options also make for an interesting, realistic experience.  The problem is the simulation timing is off. There is a dizzying, herky-jerky, pause every other second, almost as if the frames are being rendered faster than the game mechanics can react. Every minute or two, it gets so backed up that it even loses input response. Many times I had my kill or jump timed perfectly, only to have the controller become unresponsive momentarily, leaving me able to do nothing but watch Aveline's ragdoll corpse jostle about.  It is worth noting that the story kept me playing all the way through, but it was only my 30 years out of 35 in gaming experience that kept me from hurling up my lunch evertime I played. Suffice it to say, a controller was nearly laid to rest from the frustration of this unlikely game engine glitch.  And before you blame my hardware... An MSI GT70-2PE Dominator Pro, with its NVidia 880 and 8GB of Video RAM, should be able to hand this 1 year older game, with the ease of pilfering confectionary treats from a prepubescent child (like taking candy from a baby).  Addendum (One week later): Having completed the game, I can guarrantee that the story is wonderfull, however the game suffers from egregious annoyances such as enemies attacking before they can be targetted, attacks from literally invisible enemies, random hangs when reloading guns, random roof edges in open, flat areas, and the previously mentioned severe lack of smooth simulation timing. These annoyances continue throughout the game.",-1,0

3002101,260430,The Four Kings Casino and Slots,"The concept of the game is fantastic. Being able to run around and play casino games.   However the company producing the game is subpar at best. They actually don't listen to peoples ideas to help them become more stable, instead they throw tantrums and tell people (who have invested both time and money) to go find another 'free' game. That type of inconciderate behave alone drove me away.   There are an extreme amount of in game glitches that never get repaired. An occasional patch (band-aid) at best to mask a flaw in simple game coding. Plus the code, if you look at it, is horrendously disorganized, causing major game glitches and shut downs. These things get blamed on the cheap server they used despite making the big bucks from everyone buying stuff in there.  They also call the game a casino game but lately it's changed into a a casino with sublevels - space and beach, which are souly for taking people to and cyber $3xing them. Which in itself is disgusting... have you seen pictures of those of us in there? Yeah, no way Jose!

3002388,260570,Gray Matter,"This game is divided into 8 chapters and takes about an hour or so per chapter. Problems aren't always easy, but solutions are logical. The story line explores magic (like what is used in magic shows), neuroscience, ESP, and other topics. The end result is rather moving and beautiful. I will say that it is fairly easy to get stuck because the environment is huge and confusing. For this, I recommend using one of the walkthroughs to find the next location, but don't use it for any more than that! Soundtrack is pleasant and the art is simple and conveys the mood well. All in all, probably 4.5/5 stars, simply because some of the interface is a little bit glitchy, but otherwise well done and highly recommended for adventure and mystery game lovers.",1,0

I didn't like Season 2 better than the first. There was an unstable character development in the second Season 2 and the plot didn't really replicate the 'Lee' feels. What I mean by the 'unstable character development' part is that you might believe that a character's personality is a certain way but suddenly nope and you're just left there confused. Why would he do that? Why would she do that? Why the ♥♥♥♥ do I have to make a decision for this? I'm not saying that the game was bad.

3008937,261030,The Walking Dead: Season Two,"Season One was oldschool Telltale - Excellent characters and story with mild puzzle elements and the illusion of choice.   Season Two is new Telltale - Most characters are now total basket cases. Decent story, but most gameplay is eliminated in favor of following a corridor and clicking to continue. The light adventure game components have been eliminated.  To make matters worse, as Clem you can interject into conversations, but you usually are ignored as the adults talk over you. When they do listen, their replies often sound patronizing.  Season One is a masterpiece. Season Two is a glorified visual novel, and a boring one at that.",-1,0
3012777,261030,The Walking Dead: Season Two,"The Walking Dead: Season 2 picks up a ways after the first five episodes left off, putting you in the shoes of the other half of the first game's dynamic duo: Clementine. A bit older, a lot wiser, and a little bit more weary, Clementine soon finds herself entirely on her own for the first time in a while. She's learned plenty of new tricks, however, and Lee's demand that she keep going no matter what has clearly not left her ears.  While I still loved playing through The Walking Dead: Season Two as much as I did the first game, it didn't quite resonate with me as much this time around. It felt much harder to connect with the bulk of the new characters, between the pace at which they were introduced, the time spent with each of them feeling greatly reduced, and what felt like a lack of backstory for many of them. This was doubly troubling considering backstory was the motivating force for at least two, maybe three whole chapters. All but a small handful of the characters you did get to learn about felt fairly archetypical as well, rather than more nuanced, and several of the characters I thought I'd have time to learn to like had much shorter stints in the spotlight than I expected.  One thing I was grateful for was the lack of returning faces. Sure, there are definitely some familiar people who show up, and nods to the events of the first game sprinkled throughout, but it avoided being fanservice. Such returns were few, far between, and not overly hyped as the game went on; more of an 'Oh hey, I remember that,' before carrying on.  Characters new and old also suffered from a degree of stiffness in regards to their development. Whereas many of the first game's cast showed change over the course of five episodes, be it for good or for ill, while almost everyone in Season Two seemed much more set in their ways. Some cases could be written off as being hardened by their conditions for this long, but there was plenty of room for growth that never seem achieved. And, in one particular case, I spent the last episode and change yelling 'Did you learn NOTHING?' at my monitor as a certain companion seemed to have fallen into (read: was written into) a rut of sorts.  Maybe it's not entirely fair to compare Season Two to the first one, as it is its own beast, but as a sequel, it's hard to avoid that sort of thing. Even with the drawbacks I've mentioned, it's still a great continuation of Clementine's story, and one worth seeing through to the end. In fairness, I'd say this trip is even more harrowing than Clem's original ordeal, which is saying quite a bit.",1,0

3020500,261640,Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel,"I have pretty mixed feelings about this game.  1. It's more like DLC to Bl2. 2. It's not interesting. Shooting at enemies in, again, Bl2 is way more fun. 3. No actually new enemies. Tork = Spiderant. Scav = Bandit. Dahl Lost Legion is the same Bandits or Hyperion Engineers. They just renamed pld ones. 4. No new weapons. Yes, Laser are cool, but still all weapons are the same. Even Legendaries (Laser Leg do not count). 5. They put too much hope on CL4P-TP (aka FR4G-TP). He isn't unique, as the've been saying. 6. Short story line. It ends on level 25 (In Bl2 on level 30-31). And we don't have actual base. In Bl2 it's Sanctuary, where we taking most of the quests and buy ourselfs stuff. In Bl: Pre Sequel they tried to make Concordia as Sanctuary, buuut they pretty much failed. We don't have resons to go back there. Only for Black Market. But good thing in history is that it's interesting to watch how Jack turned into maniac, opened the Vault and got these scars on his face. 7. It's not worthing it's money. + Season Pass you buy separate. 8. Good thing is talking 'beind the scene'. Comments about what's happening on screen.  I guess that's it. I could say way more stuff about too huge location's with no vehicle's on them, but i won't. : ) I reccomend to buy it on sale or ask someone to buy it as a gift. : ) But Bl lovers won't see anything new here.

To save everyone a lot of opinions and reading, this game isn't the Borderlands we loved. While the old games had enough story and difficulty to last for a pretty long time, this one does not.

3021820,261640,Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel,"Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is another loot shooter that's a way too similar to Borderlands 2 for its own good.  The game is set between the two main Borderlands games and follows Handsome Jack's rise to power. Unfortunately the story is rather poorly written and the jokes are not nearly as funny as in Borderlands 2.  Most of the action takes place on Pandora's moon Elpis. This means low gravity combat and oxygen managament for outdoor environments. In practice I didn't really care too much for either mechanic. Oxygen management in particular felt rather tedious without really adding anything to the game.  The weakest part of the game, however, is the poor map and mission design. On outdoor maps it's way too easy to fall into holes and cracks that will insta-kill you. Furthermore, a lot of the missions require extensive backtracking. Combined, these two problems get old really quickly.  The core gameplay is still fun, but overall it's hard to recommend the Pre-Sequel unless you have already played Borderlands 2 to death and are still left craving for more.  I played through the game on Athena.  The good: - Fun core gameplay - Nice visual style  The bad: - Poor writing and the jokes are not funny - Visually boring outdoor environments - Oxygen management is tedious - Way too many cracks and holes that will insta-kill you - Extensive backtracking during missions",-1,0

The voice acting is painful and extremely overly faux-australian, and attempts to be endearing are grating instead.",-1,0
3023499,261640,Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel,"Late to the party but whatever!  I loved Borderlands 1 and 2, My criticism for the first game was that it was far too brown. Anyone who played it will understand what I mean. The second game improved on that, and everything else for that matter! It was fun, addictive, the story was great, the loot was epic! It was an incredible game!  So you can see why I was incredibly excited to play the pre-sequel and get more of the action right? Well, I installed the game, checked out what the different characters were about and jumped into it! From the off, playing alongside Handsome Jack was weird as hell! It was great, dont get me wrong, it was just a bit of an adjustment going from killing him to saving him!  I enjoyed the game a lot, right up until we left Jack and headed for the moon! Now, the first thing that got me was the fact that people who lived on the moon were Australian.....okay, I can roll with that, 2K Australia made the game, sure, why not.  Then there was the oxygen system, I could see that getting annoying but hey, it kind of made sense! Then I could use my O2 (It's O2.... not OZ.... that is just stupid) to manouver in the air, i could slam down and deal damage, all interesting ideas. Until the enemy humans can do the same, so you can never keep track of them, they constantly just pound you into the ground until you are begging for gravity to strengthen its hold! Honestly, it all feels a bit redundant and needless, Surely if you are a mighty vault hunter travelling through space you would have some kind of rebreather, something that would generate oxygen!  Whilst I mention the enemies, the generation of enemies in this game is screwy as hell, at level 3 and 4 I started running into badass variations of already annoying enemies! It's bad enough that these 'moon skags' divide into smaller variants when killed, but then I suddenly have to deal with badass versions at level freaking 4!? I dealt with that, okay, sure, it's more challenging in the beginning than the first two, maybe thats a good thing! Then I meet Deadlift.... The first real boss of the game and I couldn't beat him. It's only after I looked up information on the internet that I discovered I had to complete the 'optional' missions to get rewarded with a shock element gun to kill him. Right... an optional mission that the game renders almost unavoidable.  All of these problems could well have been ignored, I really could have gotten used to it if it wasn't for the godawful 'humour' that 2K Australia have pumped into this game. In the previous iterations of the game the comments that enemies would make during a fight would often cause anything from a smirk to a full blown laugh. Playing this game I found myself scratching my head, shaking my head, scrunching up my nose, The only times I smiled or chuckled were when one of the characters from the previous games made a comment or a reference.  Honestly, I think I know why Gearbox Software weren't involved with this game, they took one look at the writing, the lack of humour, and the general lack of quality that this bullymong pile of a game shows off from 2K Australia and they decided to jump ship. Honestly, after sampling this atrocity I can't help but feel the same way.  TLDR: The game is buggy. The humour is practically nonexistant and you will find yourself wishing that some of the games 'key features' just didn't exist!",-1,0

First boss is a tedious mess of jump-pads and 3-d combat, while the boss hides himself.   If you're a die-hard fan, play it. Others die-hard fans recommended this to me. I took a bite and couldn't deal with it. They, however, could. So do it if you're a big fan.   For me though, this game tried to do what BL and BL2 did, and so far It doesn't scale up.

It is exactly what you would expect in the GT series (humor and all things considered).  The only difference is that the game is much shorter than the other 2 and way more linear.  Here are a few observations:  - The environment is a lot more vibrant thanks to the cell shading and the tropical theme. It's a shame that the game was so short. - Not much has changed as far as the hud/interface goes. I expected a more refined design seeing as this is the 3rd game in the series. - The game was too easy. Even with the difficulty slider, there's not a huge leap in content difficulty.  As you can see, I don't have a lot to say about the game. It was just way too short in my opinion. As I already mentioned, this game brings more of the same from the first 2 games.

A big annoyance for me is the unskippable animations: with a turn-based game it's nice that you can take forever to decide what to do if you want, but it would be nice if at the other end you could also input your moves and get through things really fast if you had it all planned out in advance. Sadly the game puts a minimum on how long it will take you for each turn, so you have to sit there and watch the animations over and over again. Maybe they are afraid that if people could play their turns really fast they would find out even faster that the content is hideously repetitive and unfun.",-1,1

The problem is that the difficulty comes from very cheap and poorly indicated enemy movements. You may be a few minutes into the level only to die in a mere second from an enemy flying from behind your back and coliding with you, forcing you to restart. There are checkpoints, but they are rather scarce. And unlike many proper bullet hells, here there's so much going on on the screen, with stuff coming from all directions, that dodging everything is impossible. You may take some hits, but once you collide with something your health drops drastically.  It's sad, because everything else is great. The graphics, the sound effects, the soundtrack, tons of customization and a nice upgrade system. It would have been great, but the difficulty simply kills all the enjoyment. And I really hate when games rely on memorization through repetition to even beat a level.  I'd say that if you've got the patience to repeat the same level segments over and over only to get them right after tons of deaths, and the overall style of J'n'G appeals to you, then you could consider the purchase.

The tutorial misses a LOT, and you quickly find yourself wondering what to do next, what to focus on, and how the mechanics of the game work. Many problems are found in the first 30 minutes of playing (e.g. 'hire X person to enable upgrade feature'. Hire that person, game still says 'hire this person to enable this feature'). Controls are frustrating (Can't easily move people between desks, have to do 1 at a time, which becomes increasingly lengthy when your offices are jam packed. This includes other micro-managing such as schedules, very cumbersome and frustrating design), the reports are semi-pointless and unhelpful, many offer no useful information and they also don't link to in-game objects (can see a report of employee happiness, but cant click to view employee, you must remember their name and scourer through your offices trying to find them). This game lacks a lot, and while it could be an excellent sim with a great and fun concept, it is poorly designed and bites off more than it can chew. Spend your money elsewhere, there are many other office sims which perform far better.",-1,0

I've heard lots and lots of commentaries/reviews about how hard and unforgiving this game is, even to the point where they had to restart the whole game because they just couldn't grind their way back up, when in fact it is too easy. All you have to do is just spend every skillpoint into damage and get spread shot, split shot and life steal, the other last 2 don't matter too much, ammo drops far too often and mushrooms (yes, mushrooms) boost you too much. Over 6000 possible combinations of your attack? Around  50  useful ones, yeah. That's pretty much it. Only 1 save slot that gets   deleted   after you've beaten the game, that's just stupid. Having a pretty high firing rate with spread shot and split shot makes the game terribly lag, too.

3055330,263420,Probably Archery,"I've played this game since the 7DFPS version and trialed the demo when it was on Greenlight. The concept of the game is unique and interesting, but the execution of the full release leaves a bit to be desired and seems to be a stray shot.  Getting the hang of the controls is half the fun. However, once you understand how the bow and the arms work (as a veteran of Probably Archery, and probably a real-life archer), the challenge is significantly diminished since repetition of the correct technique is not at all difficult. Unless you're going for pinpoint accuracy and high scores, you can beat all the minigames within 20 minutes.  The minigames need much more depth. There are several shooting gallery-like levels, with the more interesting ones including the charging Berserker and the Warband, and the need Eggsterminator one is a chuckle and the most fun. The problem is that these minigames are single-level experiences, with the exception of the Berserker, which only has four very quick levels. I don't imagine it's difficult to code in different levels for each minigame (different target layout, more challenges, etc.). Unfortunately, you'll get the feeling of 'Wait, that's it?' when you complete a minigame.  I can't get into any multiplayer games. I don't know whether it's because not many people are playing it, or not many people around me are playing it. Nonetheless, that seems to be where the most replay is, with Team Deathmatch and Horde Mode with multiple waves. But it'd be nice to have single-player versions of those too.  I have no idea why Zombie Soccer is part of this game. It feels like a side-project tacked onto the game to add value. I haven't been able to actually play an online match, but it otherwise doesn't look or feel good.  Basically, the game has good mechanics but poor replay value. There's simply no depth to the minigame experience. Most of the time spent in the game is figuring out how the controls work, but once you've mastered that, it's not something you'd probably go back to. In some ways, the free Greenlight Demo was more enjoyable -- and free. To pay ~$10 for this game, I'd expect more replay value.",-1,0

Four extremely generic classes await you, with four different faces to put on your character guaranteeing you end up looking like everyone else. The gathering/crafting system talked up for this game is very generic as well; the steps are get tool, click object, wait a second, get item, go to crafting bench, combine two items, get end product. There's no game to it, it's just another grinding simulation, like Farmville. The character models look goofy but without any kind of cartoony charm, instead just looking stiff and strange like a Sim gone wrong, with too much chin and a weird dead-eyed expression. And it's a quest based game, which guarantees you'll be grinding from start to finish; 'bring me 10 spider silks and I'll let you progress'. The combat system is as generic as you get; click the enemy, right click to auto attack, and number keys for skills. As for technical issues, the game would not recognize my USB headphones and would only play through the laptop speakers, and I had to install the game three times because two of those times it crashed Steam and didn't show up in my games list.

3067619,264140,Pixel Piracy,"Game just started getting TERRIBLE fps drop/lag (probably about 9th hour in the game) and is unplyable. some sort of memory leak issue/bug I think. kept my interest until then but now I can't play it until there is some sort of bug fix or something.  Edit: I got past it by removing my ships sail, would be fine if it was strictly for looks, but it actually has gameplay mechanics (faster ship) to it, making some of these problems kind of pathetic for a game out of 'early access'  some of these problems?  When building a ship if you have more then 20 ship pieces (which you WILL if you play more then ten hours or so) you CAN NOT. I repeat CAN NOT, scroll through them in any way, any pieces lower then 20 are completely inaccessible for there is no scroll or down arrow to get to them.... hope they weren't too important....  The tips/guide is simply terrible, not a huge deal because it's a relatively simple game. but the hints seemed to get stuck because I did a tutorial thing before it told me, I then couldn't do it and the text seemed to stay on the screen until i turned it off.  There are certain things that aren't well explained. For one, the stats. I apparently have over 100% chance to hit, if that's the case why can I go take a ♥♥♥♥ (in real life) while my pirate and the enemy pirate are just trading 'misses' for nearly 5 minutes straight (not even an exaggeration)  This honestly isn't even a big deal if the mechanics were explained like 'well it's your dextarity matched against enemies 'agility' or something like that, which is what I have to assume but will never know I guess.  as for the second problem with stats VITALITY seems completely useless 'health regen' is all it seems to do. which would be COOL if it actually worked in combat. it doesn't... so it's one of those stats you throw a couple points into and never touch again because there are better ways to heal on your ship like a crew member with 'doctor aura'  Furthermore, The weapons level up with use, simple satisfying mechanic. the only thing is... the ranged weapons don't... you can find grindstones in the game that give you a chance to level a weapon (seperate for ranged and melee) and the higher the level the less chance it is to upgrade, you literally cannot level ranged weapons to max in ANY way. another very simple pathetic flaw about the game, should have been fixed on day one. actual bugs aside, there is no viable way to make ranged pirates, so if you wanted to be a pistol wielding pirate look elsewhere, the pistols cooldown is way too long to be viable and the pirates will just face rush the enemy like every other character in the game, all characters are MELEE in this game.  You gain notoriety by doing bounties. what this does, I don't know. it seems like logically it should make it less likely to be interupted by other pirate encounters while sailing but it doesn't seem to be the case. that would be great because sometimes you want to sail somewhere far without it taking 20 minutes because your interrupted 2-3 times.  Some weapons can level to 100. logically you would think that these weapons would start a bit worse but end up being 15-20% then weapons that level to 50... this doesn't seem to be the case with weapons I have tested. it also takes FOR-EV-VER to level a 100 weapon, basically you can do a single one in a playthrough. overall weapon design and balance seems poor. lategame all that really seems to matter is attack speed.  variety after playing a bit seems very poor. It's really just the same formula over and over, with bigger numbers the further from the middle of the map you get. This leads you to not really want to explore but to rush from boss to boss, stopping only to sell junk, repair your ship, and leveling if you have to gain some power (which is interesting in itself because it seems like once you can kill one boss you can just kill the others with ease because from what I've experienced they are all basically the same exact encounter)  Where are unique monster islands?  maybe an island instead of having pirates it has a giant cyclops with unique loot. Maybe a kraken could attack your ship while sailing, for a uniqe encounter. just a couple ideas, this game sorely lacks stuff like this.   The game is very simple, very repetive, but if you like grindy loot games you can definately have a bit of fun with it, but OVERALL this game feels very unfinished to me and currently I can't recommend it at ten dollars. In it's current state, if it's on sale for a couple bucks it might be a fun time waster but highly advise not getting it until it's dirt cheap or fixed.  Also if you do buy it (again hopefully not for more then a couple bucks) do yourself a favor and just play hard mode your first time. It will require 5-6 extra islands and ships to grind early game then make no difference whatsoever after that. so you might as well pick hard because once you beat this it's unlikely you will want to play it again. Now you can atleast say you beat it on the highest difficulty.",-1,1

3102968,265210,Viscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage,"Like all the Viscera Cleanup Detail games, I heartily recommend this! These guys just keep pumping out original content while polishing the main game for release. I thought this was a gag when my friends first told me about it and I'm glad I was wrong.   This edition was a treat. Viscera Cleanup Detail is all about you trying to clean up someone else's mess after everything gets bloody and blown up. This time, you're going to the North Pole. Santa's workshop is a colorful wonderland and your in game radio's Christmas tunes do a good job of keeping your spirits up as you dispose of dynamite, knives, and tons of elf bodies. Oh, and lots of empty whiskey bottles.  I have to touch on the cons though, before I can say what else I love about this game. Dynamite is ihe bane of this particular iteration. When Santa went crazy, he went dynamite happy. Careless handling of dynamite can toss messes way out of the reach of your mop, leading to lots of profanity and frustrations and rendering a full cleanup almost impossible. Given that the bucket machine now tosses live dynamite at you on occasion, it just feels like the devs are being unfair to the players. Of all the messes the space janitor has had to clean up, this may be the hardest. And while the warm mood lighting makes this game's setting pop with color, it also has the unfortunate side effect of making some of the lightest blood stains super hard to see, especially against the wood grains. Hopefully this might be corrected in a future version of the game, but at least your trusty sniffer still works well for finding the lost messes. Back to the pros!  The gameplay VCD is known for is still here, and, like they did in the Shadow Warrior level, there are side objectives you can do as well for Steam achievements, namely tracking down all of the toy guns and officially licensed Rooks Keep action figures for your trunk. When you clock out, the punchout machine lists what souvenirs you dropped into your trunk. There are also numerous achievements for how well you cleaned. Did you manage to not break any of the delicate Christmas ornaments around the shop? Did you scorch the place clean of all holiday items? Did you throw your bucket dispenser's hat into the fire? The number of Steam achievements here gives the game some replayability beyond trying to see how fast or how messy you can clean things up.   The black humor found in the game's macabre setting is hit and miss, however; some of the fun in a new level of VCD is seeing how awful the messes are and figuring out a way to efficiently get things done. Some of the outlandish deaths and scenes you uncover work great, but I think the humor found in Santa's letters that outline his descent into booze and bullets felt like the writers were trying too hard. There are nuggets of humor but we get it when all the kids just want the latest expensive gadgets even though they behave like brats.

3105932,265300,Lords Of The Fallen,"Meh... this says it all really. The graphics and settings are great if you want a game that looks epic but doesnt perform in the same way and is very bugged out. NG+ is utterly pointless apart from levelling up a different class with skill points as i went through NG+ without finding anything new and collected a variety of shards instead of new armour or weapons. Personally i think the game is far too short and the side quests are nothing major and to be honest i found myself not doing them in the end, doing them would not have made this game any better for me. I wouldn't recommend but this is only my personal opinion. If you have it and enjoyed it, fair play or if you choose to buy it i hope you enjoy it... but for me im disappointed.",-1,0
3106026,265300,Lords Of The Fallen,"Lords of the Fallen really isn't that bad of a game, but I found it to be lacking in depth. It is praised as a 'Dark Souls-like' but only really reminds me of Dark Souls on the surface. And in that way, it is just like any other game in this genre, so it really doesn't stand out to me.  My issue with this game basically boils down to one point, and that is this: All character builds are too similar. You have one build type, and that is 'bulky guy with big melee weapon'. Yes there are 'light' and 'heavy' armors but the difference between them is hardly noticable, visually or in action. In Dark Souls, if you put on lighter armor you get hit harder but are more maneuverable. Heavier armor has the opposite effect. In Lords of the Fallen, every armor class makes you roll the same and move the same. It's boring and makes me feel very limited in how I can approach the game. The Magic is incredibly lackluster as well; all it really is is buffs and debuffs, with one actual offensive 'spell' for each set. No matter what kind of character you try to build, they are all going to feel the same, whereas in Dark Souls a lightweight build or a heavy, 2h build or a mage are WILDLY different from one another.   If you don't like too many different genres and have already been through some of the other games in this genre then maybe this one is for you. But if you are hoping it will live up to any of the hype or really even compare to the other great games on the market in this genre, then prepare to be disappointed.",-1,0

There were a few puzzles, I think 3 in total, none requireing much thought, they were typical puzzles, nothing new or unique.

3125908,265890,Hexcells,"(9/10) Very intriguing premise for a puzzle game, sort of a hybrid of picross and minesweeper, but on a hex board of course. The only thing holding it back is a very finite number of puzzles but hey thats what sequels are for.",1,0
3126021,265890,Hexcells,"It IS an abstract puzzle, like minesweeper or sudoku or something like that, and it has a nice atmospheric sound and visuals to go along with it, but that's all it really is, honestly. It feels really insubstantial. Simply adding more levels isn't what I want, either. Nor is adding more mechanics. I just think it's hard to make an abstract puzzle game feel as fun as some of the other games out there. It took me 2-3 hours to 100% and I didn't really end it feeling like I was glad I played it.   Plus, the music loop starts to get annoying after awhile. It's too short, plays too often, and isn't mixed in with other tracks.   And the core gameplay loop is pretty much just - reveal the obvious stuff, then hunt around for the next thing you can reveal. That's not that fun to me compared to what you do in other games. It's not the lack of action or anything - I'm fine with slow-paced, turn-based, or other puzzle games. It's just the lack of problem solving - this game is all deduction and very little intuition. I like working with and experimenting with a hard problem and going over it in my head and trying different avenues of solutions and trying to come up with observations and rules and constraints that I can use to simplify the problem. You can find that core gameplay loop in lots of excellent puzzle games, but you won't find it here.  If you like minesweeper or sudoku you should definitely give this a try. Otherwise, even if you're a huge fan of puzzle games like me, I'd probably avoid this. You're not going to find that problem-solving engagement and stimulation here, unlike what you'd find in lots of other puzzle games. There's no experimenting, discovery, or anything like that. It's just 'oh here's the next spot for which I can prove its contents' and 'hmm, where's the next one?'.  As a counterexample, an abstract puzzle game I DID enjoy was Splice (you might argue that it's not TRULY abstract since it uses a sort of biological metaphor, but I think of it as one). That game has plenty of that 'problem solving high' you get as you experiment and observe and work through a complex problem.",-1,0

There are many things good and bad that i did not mention because the list would drag on. Over all this is not a game you would spend countless hours on because there isn't anything to do.

3156331,266130,Breach & Clear,"Breach &amp; Clear is an interesting marriage of Frozen Synapse's hybrid turn-based/real-time style of tactics gameplay with XCOM: Enemy Unknown’s customizable class-based soldiers and carefully-constructed mission levels, then given a Counter-Strike terrorists-vs.-special-forces makeover - right down to the almighty flashbang grenade.  Upon first starting up the game, the player will be greeted by a series of screens to set up their first squad. They can choose from a variety of different special forces outfits from around the world, from the American Navy SEALS to the German Kommando Spezialkräfte, among others.  The player can choose the faces, names, and soldier classes for each member of their 4-man squad. Each of the six classes has a unique role to play with their special abilities and passive traits, and having to choose which to bring and which to forego should be carefully considered, as it will significantly affect how you approach different situations from that point on.  Every mission starts by selecting which entry points to place the soldiers at before they storm the room, or otherwise enter the combat area. Enemies inside rooms that have no open doors cannot be seen (conversely, every enemy in an outdoor area can be seen), meaning you will sometimes be storming a building blind. As such, the player has to carefully survey the map layout, note cover near to every door, and account for every angle an enemy might be waiting at before breaching the entrance. Sometimes it might even be favorable to split your team into two groups of two as opposed to keeping all four together.  At the start of each turn, the player will issue orders to all four of their soldiers during a “planning phase” - where to move (and along what path - an option XCOM sorely neglected), what direction to face, what inventory equipment or special abilities to use. When everything is set, all four men will simultaneously execute your orders in real-time during an “action phase”, as will the enemies act. Some of the enemies’ actions are proactive, and some are reactionary - especially in response to any grenades you throw. This is unlike Frozen Synapse, where the enemy soldiers will follow their turn’s orders to a T regardless of what yours do.  This also leads to an important interesting factor introduced in Breach &amp; Clear that XCOM notably fails to consider: noise. Guns are loud, and if you hear a bunch going off in the next room, most militiamen would go check out what’s going on. Every gun you give your soldiers and some modifications you can apply to said guns have a “noise” trait which affects how loud the weapon is. The louder the guns in your squad, the more likely an unseen enemy in another room will come and investigate. This can lead to some real “Oh shi-” panic moments if your men are caught flanked or out of cover when this happens, especially in areas with many closed doors and little cover - such as the living quarters on a cargo ship. To account for this, the player must carefully position their soldiers to cover the squad’s flanks at all times, or trade in some lethality for low-profile, silenced guns.  There is a half cover/full cover system similar to the one in XCOM: different objects in the environment will either provide moderate or significant protection to the soldier behind it, depending on the object’s size. There is one notable difference to XCOM’s implementation, especially on the higher difficulties: barring sniper rifles, soldiers shooting at each other from cover to cover will often have a very hard time actually scoring hits. This forces the player to use all of the tools at their disposal to outmaneuver the enemy and gain flanking shots, rather than simply relying on a boosted aim stat. This really strengthens the tactical depth of an otherwise relatively simple set of mechanics, which is great - it makes the fundamentals easy to grasp, but achieving victory is a very deliberate process that rewards planning and smart execution.  The soldier progression and customization system adds that XCOM-like personal attachment to your men. As the player completes missions, they will unlock items for your men to use. These items range from weapons and attachments to body armor and helmets to cosmetic-only elements like camouflage and sunglasses. Each man can also be kitted out with two inventory items - typically a grenade of some kind or a medkit, or a revival defibrillator if your squad lacks a medic.  Completing missions will also earn each soldier XP. As they level up, they will unlock new class-specific passive bonuses and, eventually, a powerful special ability that can only be used once per mission (for example, a Fireteam Leader can provide a “morale boost” that grants a large stat bonus to the entire squad for one turn).  Leveling up soldiers also allows the player to choose what stats to upgrade on a given soldier, whether it be how fast they can acquire targets, how far they can run in a turn, the effectiveness of their class bonus, etc. This lets the player choose whether they want to make a squad of jacks-of-all-trades, or to specialize their soldiers to excel at certain things at the expense of others. For example, Breachers (the grenade-tossing class that often leads the charge) might find specializing in health and target acquisition useful so that he can more effectively fight as he crosses open ground.  With the variety of mission environments offered by the game’s numerous mini-campaigns, collecting a range of gear - sniper rifles, machine guns, loud and silenced weapons, fast-but-light and slow-but-sturdy body armor, etc. - is important to maintaining a flexible force, especially considering that every level can be played in three different scenarios with varying levels of enemy numbers and emphasis on speed. Overall, the persistent soldier system and surprising amount of content offers a considerable amount of gameplay for such a small title.  Despite all these features, Breach &amp; Clear is not without its flaws. The relative simplicity of the movement system compared to the one in Frozen Synapse - mainly the lack of an option to tell a soldier to wait a couple seconds before moving - can sometimes make synchronizing your soldiers’ actions difficult. This is especially noticeable when attempting to follow a flashbang grenade into a room; it won’t stun your own soldiers, but it will give the enemy a moment to pepper your men with bullets as they enter before the grenade goes off.  Additionally (and this was an enormous gripe that I had with XCOM: Enemy Unknown, too), all the voiceovers are in a standard American English dialect, regardless of which international commando outfit your soldiers belong to. Not only, but the vast majority of weapons in the game are ones used by the United States and Canada, despite the wide international breadth of options for the men themselves. This can likely be attributed to the game originally launching with only American and Canadian task groups, with the others being added only later. Given the size of the team making the game (spoiler alert: it’s pretty small), this is somewhat understandable, but it's still disappointing that I can't arm my Spetsnaz team with the latest Kalash AK-12s and have them bark responses in their native tongue - or at least in a cheesy Russian accent.  These blemishes, however, are relatively minor stumbles on what is, at its core, a very satisfying experience. While the soldier progression system isn't quite as fleshed out as XCOM's, and the unit movement system not quite as intricate as Frozen Synapse's, the two fused together with the game’s own handful of unique features make a very fun and surprisingly deep tactics game that is both easy to pick up and complex to conquer. For only $15, I would consider Breach &amp; Clear worth checking out for any fan of tactics or small-scale strategy.",1,0

3165927,266510,Hand of Fate,"I was suspect at first, but so far this is a really great game.   I haven't sunk in as many hours as i'd like, but i'm over half way through the story mode.  Basically, its a rogue-like, and the fighting portions are a mix of Fable and Arkham Asylum. Your character will develope each session in a table-top game kind of style. Encounters will often present in a 'pick a card' luck based system. You're not completely subjected to the luck system. You can take note of the winning card before hand and try to follow it as it shuffles. Sometimes you win. Sometimes you get bit hard.  Make no mistake, a single RNG luck-based encounter can kill your character. I had a character with extra life, food and gold, and awesome gear. Then I bumped into a Devil, and he took me down to 8 health, gave me extra tough monsters, and I died in one hit.   But this isn't a bad thing. It's not a huge loss. If you lose a session you'll likely still unlock something. You'll never lose hours of progress. The setbacks are very minor, and the potential progress always outweighs the loss.   You will get frustrated every now and then, you'll get back-to-back sessions of getting your ♥♥♥ spanked by RNG and bad luck. But you won't reach that Dark Souls level of rage where you want to throw your computer across the room.  Endless Mode is very unforgiving. The RNG seems very slanted against you in it, but it provides a legit challenge, and you will need some luck to get far.   This is a great game. It's a high quality rogue-like, with elements of a table-top game. The graphics in fight scenes look great. The sound is great, especially when listening to The Dealer doll out cards as your session progresses.   The game is worth the money. I was fortunate to pick it up on the summer sale.   If they keep adding content to this game, it will be a no brainer as far as adding it to your library.   Do it! Just do it!",1,0

I would guess that we are not going to see long-term support with this game, since it looks like it sold badly.  Updated review because of game leaving Early Access: Everything in the review is still relevant. Only change is increased thread locking and post deleting in the forums. Here's a post I made about the Early Access price supposed to be lower than the release price before my reply was deleted and the thread locked:   http://imgur.com/FNe0Pdy   MAIN REVIEW FOLLOWS: ----------------------------------------  I have been holding off writing this review because the game could be so good and I was hoping it would change.   This is a hex-based wargame in the SotS universe and that's exciting stuff. (I just realized that will sound like a joke to non-wargame fans, but it's true).  Based on the screenshots you would think was a cool, deep, fun game. The information in the encyclopedia in game is a nice touch.  Try to play the game though and you'll find a confusing, fiddly mess. There are far too many phases and lots of fiddly things you have to keep doing. The user interface is really bad both in usability and in showing you what's going on. A lot of this is because of the developers making the bad decision to have a 'unified user interface' on mobile and PC, which means no tooltips, only one button used and no scrolling when you get your mouse to the edge of the screen. This cripples the PC UI and the developers flat-out refuse to change it to make the PC version easier to use.  The tutorial has been through a few changes but still remains awful at teaching you the game. This is both due to the content of the tutorial and the way it is presented, which makes it hard to tie together the UI with what the flash-card like windows are telling you.  I bought the game at the start of the Early Access on Steam and I was disappointed to find out that the game was not as finished as I thought it would be. From the store page it seemed like the only thing missing were some campaign missions, and the ironing out of the last few bugs:  'With this Early Access release, Ground Pounders is feature complete, and the main differences between now and final release - besides a few last minute cards and units - is there is only 1 campaign (instead of 2) and 5 scenarios (instead of ten).'  It turned out that early adopters really were unpaid beta testers and only by assiduously playing when it wasn't fun and giving feedback could we turn the game into the good game it had the potential to be. I mean, it wasn't just bug fixing, there were actually changes to how the game worked, and there was really the feeling that the game hadn't been tested at all before putting it on steam.  I did this for a short while but then I just couldn't be bothered any more- it was just not fun. I decided to put the game down until they finished it and see how it was. As of today the game is still in Early Access but is 66% off on a certain online game store. Because the Steam store page went out of its way to point out that we were saving money by buying into the Early Access game at the start vs. buying when it launched I felt a bit betrayed by this; I also took it as a sign that the studio may be in some sort of trouble. The game was planned to be released in March according to the Steam store page and it's almost June now with no release so maybe that's why.  Anyway, I suppose if you do get a deep discount on this or even get it in a bundle (there have been a lot of Early Access games in bundles recently) then it may turn out to be the game you expect, but at the moment it's unlikely that it is.  edited to say something positive: The music is good. That's the only thing to like about it though really.",-1,1

3180635,268200,Antisquad,"Antisquad looks like a pretty fun little squad based tactical game. However, before you start playing, there are some differences between Antisquad and other quality games which you should know about:  First and foremost, excessive clicking is required. It appears that this game was made for phones or tablets. Now, maybe this is only true during the lengthy tutorial, but I wouldn't know. I never got past the game holding my hand as if I were a semi-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child.  Duuuurrrrr...I mean secondly, the tutorial. During the tutorial the game will only allow you to do exactly as the game instructs you. Even if you click somewhere else, nothing happens. I will note that Antisquad does a very adept job at telling you how the game works during the first mission, but after that I firmly believe they should leave you alone. Instead, going into the second mission the game is still like that creepy uncle that just hangs around and wants to hold your hand. I did not make it past the second mission because, personally, I prefer to figure games out on my own, at my own pace, and am not afraid of failing miserably once or twice while doing so. Though, with the simplicity of Antisquad, I doubt even the most mentally challenged gamers will fail to complete missions successfully from what I've seen.  In conclusion, the game is graphically appealing and may even be fun. I just can't help but feel a little violated after all of the excessive hand holding and whisperings of sweet nothings in my ear as I attempt to play.  10/10 GOTY",-1,0
3180966,268220,Meltdown,"Meltdown is very much like Dead Effect, as in it's a port from the tablet platform! However, this game is much more refined in many ways.  First, it's an RPG with heavy shooting elements. This is what happens when you combine Diablo with Contra, and to some degree it reminds me of 'Shoot Many Robots'! The RPG elements are everywhere, and offer a variety of means to customize your adorablly gruff looking space marine. You can level up and strengthen your favorite guns or pieces of armor, giving you the kind of space marine that you want! Want to be a tank? Want to be fast? Want to be a lethal killing machine? This game gives you a fair amount of options, regardless of the uninspired and basic upgrades that don't change the gameplay too much.  Second, despite being a port from tablet, it's yet another great port with a decent amount of options. V-sync, graphics options, and other options are available to meet all your basic needs. The graphics are actually kind of nice, they have a great aesthetic style that takes advantage of the limited hardware on a tablet, but clearly with added HD effects for the PC version. This is one case where motion blur actually looks kind of nice! It's nothing to write home about for a PC game, the graphics, but the textures look detailed in some areas and there is some lovely use of camera lens flare effects.  However, the game has no story to speak of, at least for the most part. But there is something very endearing about how simple this game is. It tells you your objective, like a classic game on the NES would, and throws you into a colorful sci-fi world with that objective in mind: Kill all the malfunctioning robots and eliminate the source of the problem! The stages might look similiar to eachother during this mission, despite being randomized at times, but you'll have a blast on this addictive sci-fi space marine adventure!  Meltdown is a highly reccomended game. It's simple, charming, addictive, and packed with more content than the price tag eludes to!",1,0

3185068,268500,XCOM 2,"For starters, it is really sad that people are giving Firaxis a free pass with this. I'm a big fan of the XCOM franchise, and I've been hyped for a long time to finally get my hands on XCOM 2.  Unfortunately, it seems like Firaxis just tricked us into buying the game with the whole 'built with PCs in mind' thing. I'm running the game with a GTX 970, 8gb RAM and an i5 3570. This trio is capable of maxing almost all games released these days, and XCOM 2 is the first game to launch the 'completely unplayable games' list.  Vsync is locking the game at 30fps, but even disabled it is hard to get past the now removed cap. People can argue that you can turn your settings down to make it 'playable', however I cannot find a reason to do that when you spend so much money with a good graphics card. Another big bummer is that the cutscenes are rendered in 30fps. I thought we were way past that when the devs said the game was going to launch exclusively for PC, a platform well known for superior performance in games. For what reason would you lock the cutscenes in 30fps when most gamers want to experience the whole game in 60fps?  I will refrain from talking about the gameplay for a while, but from what I could play, it just looks like good old XCOM. I'm going to keep this review updated, I just couldn't give it a thumbs up or let people give their thumbs up and say the game is almost unplayable. The newest Naruto game was released today and people aren't giving Bandai the same free pass for delivering a subpar experience.

3185182,268500,XCOM 2,"I love the entire XCOM and UFO franchise. I played all previous games, I preordered XCOM2, I was waiting like for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ christmas.  But no. I'm disappointed, I'm very disappointed.  Because it's not strategy right now. It's 'rush forward and wish for lucky shot or reload latest save if you miss'. Timers, timers everywhere. Every mission crucial for the plot is on timer, main quest on strategic map is on timer, but that's not the problem. Problem is that these timers are set up so you have no tactical or strategical options other that mindlessly rushing forward. Only other choise is defeat from running out of time. You can't outflank enemies, you can't set up ambushes, you can't walk around them because CLOCK IS TICKING.  Why? First XCOM didn't have those (yeah, terror misions, but they make sense. It's either aliens kill everyone around, or you manage to kill aliens faster, no issue here). Technically you could take all the time you wanted. But the aliens were also growing and advancing, they were attacking, they were getting new units and new toys. There was no clock but the pressure was there all the time. That's the difference between enjoying the challenge the games gives you and just being worried seeing diminishing turn counter. I want a game where I have to worry about long term decisions and about outsmarting enemies on tactical level, not go Call of Duty dakka-dakka style.  Then there is performance issues. It's not even about FPS drops. New games always have issues like that, they will probably patch it soon.  But visible animation issues? You can see where animation of soldier running ends and animation of sticking to cover begins. And after you complete some action the game just waits for several seconds like it is thinking what to do now. Or my soldiers lands a shot at the enemy even if he is looking in COMPLETELY different direction. THOSE WERE ALL PRESENT IN FIRST XCOM. HOW MANY YEARS YOU HAD TO CORRECT THOSE?  And this feature of editing how your soldiers look and behave? You advertised this as best thing since sliced bread. It's just few options more than first XCOM. And what logic allows you to edit those only after soldier get higher ranks?  If I had to rate the game.  As a standalone game, not looking at the title - 6/10.  Big game, lot of content, good graphics, complex, yet annoying mechanics. Still much better than most other on the market. As one of the XCOM series - 2/10.

The classes are far more interesting and have less obvious choices as to how to build them. The game prevents you from using the same tired 'overwatch all day' strategy from the previous game. I hear alot of people complain about mission timers, and i do think they get overbearing, but missions for the most part have so far given me enough time to do them.  My issue with the game, and why i simply cannot reccomend it, is the disatrous performance issues. Even on the lowest settings on a computer that can run games like witcher 3 on the near highest settings at 60, this game chugs and chugs and chugs even on the lowest settings. It chugs when loading the main menu and missions, it chugs when you throw a grenade, it chugs when something explodes, it chugs when the aliens take a turn or do literally everything. This game would be a glowing reccomendation from me , but until these nonsensical performance issues are fixed, dont buy it. Wait till a sale or for when the issues are patched",-1,0
3185333,268500,XCOM 2,"It's the same game as X-COM 1, but with more constant, annoying interruptions from Captain Sweater(now mildly grizzled) and, somehow, worse storytelling. It'd also be nice to be able to click a button without a damn cutscene. It feels like the game also aggressively wastes my time every time I take an action, by trying to extend them with as many animation flourishes as possible. It's neat the first, to be positive, ten times, but after that it just makes you wish the game would get on with it.  I eagerly await when Firaxis will start releasing actual games again, rather than full-conversion mods of stuff they've already done, while pretending they've actually spent time programming and designing(Looking at you, Civ: Beyond Earth).  If you're buying this at full price, you're being cheated, because there's practically nothing in here that a crew of modders could not have added to X-COM 1 over the course of a few months, and most of the actual mechanics changes are negligible or, incredibly enough, make the game worse.",-1,1

This I can also say about multiplayer, my favorite part of xcom, however this new game is a big disappointment to me and I feel robbed of my money. It is chock full of bugs, performance issues, and aside from the occasional cinematics, it gets quite boring. Even in the beginning I've done over 12 'missions' which LITERALLY was just moving your soldiers to the 'intel' that you 'hack' and then the mission is 'flawless.' Where the hell are the aliens? Eventually some aliens started showing up but by then they were already upgraded in armor and weapons since the 'dark events' had progressed but with no damn aliens to kill for so many missions I didn't get all my parts I needed to research.   The multiplayer also is terribly designed. Not only did they remove the fine customization options you had in the past but it is full of bugs also. I literally had 4 matches where people would join my game and it would kick them or we just sat there both of us with the 'ready' status and nothing happening. To add annoyance, the clock would go from 69 seconds to 4 seconds randomly, then zero and just hang there. With nothing happening. Then all of a sudden the opponent's acctions would start coming through. It was unplayable period. For as many 'bugs' as the old XCOM had, at least those bugs allowed the game to be playable and added meta gaming to the tactics. This just adds frustration.  The only thing I found even remotely good was the soldier appearance customization (even that needs work), being able to save their appearance was good too, and the ability to do small 'upgrades' to weapons was neat. The level of textures and graphic options are pretty nice too. The story seems intriguing enough for any xcom player, however it really isnt anything much. I am hoping a future mod will make this game worth it. As it stands now I can't recommend it, especially the MP side of the game.",-1,0
3189233,268500,XCOM 2,"Buy Xcom Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within Instead...  The whole game just rushes you and puts players in a state of discomfort. Turn limits on 95% of missions, Turn limits on the campaign map forcing you to do missions you dont want to do. Massive learning curve that makes the games first level harder then the first games last level. Unfair enemies with cheap attacks that cannot be countered with anything other then luck. The turn limit forces rash and untactical, chance based decisions. No playing after the story concludes and so on, so forth. Overall, the game is like a psycotic girlfriend that is obsessing over you to the point where shes asking for a wedding after the first week. The game has cool features, but its just rushed so much that its uncomfortable to play.  I simply cannot give it a good rating, because it was neither more tactical, fun or enjoyable then the first game. It feels rushed and stressful. The only thing better about this one was the character customization which was the only plus.  Mods helped fix a few of the issues, but im not going give a good rating to a game that needs mods to fix its most basic mechanics. Watch the DLC include ways to fix these issues... they want your wallet. Pre orders and season pass is just proof that DLC was planed... so why would they allow you to keep playing after the vanilla game?",-1,0

3191224,268500,XCOM 2,"The first game was ground-breaking; a true classic. I've logged countless hours and beat it many times.  XCOM 2 improves on the first game in every way imaginable. Unfortunately, this game is only for the hardcore players of the first game. People who are new to XCOM would likely be put off by the difficulty of this one, even when set to the lowest difficulty.  You may find yourself doing the quicksave/quickload quite often. That's a very unsatisfying way to play a game.  If I had known how hard it was, I would not have spent the money.",-1,0
3191612,268500,XCOM 2,"Before anything to tell I must mention that my really first impression of this game was being totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off. I installed it on my main machine that is powerful enough for everything I throw at it - and it did not even start. It was complaining about a missing vcomp120.dll file that was of course already installed before and not a single game or application (I work with audio and video editors that can run flawless only in a stable system and they do) had any complain about anything. I tried a couple of simple solutions but none of them worked so for testing I just installed the game on my older backup machine that has less than half the power with half the RAM and CPU cores and a less powerful (but still nice) ASUS GT730 videocard. For some reason I don't know the game started there normally and I play it on that machine. It is not maxed out but runs quite okay. X-COM 2 never froze ingame but after exiting the game make the OS crash various GFX and DX11 modules 1 out of 4 times that renders the machine useless for further accelerated GFX. Well... The 2012 X-COM game was stable like hell and I could get it run from XP to W10. How the hell could it happen to the new game and how the hell it haven't been fixed yet?  C'mon Firaxis...  If it was a car, compared to the previous version, it has a ♥♥♥♥ed up ignition, slightly less features, nicer looking chassis, a more powerful but less reliable engine. All-round is less on the scales but it's also more fun / challenge to drive.  Pros / Cons:  + more variety of the missions + better combat tactical depth + 'support' class changing to 'specialist' give interesting options + easier to get into the pace + interesting opponents + it is harder than the predecessor  - 'vcomp120.dll missing' and other bugs, much less well coded than the predecessor - I miss mech / aug soldiers and separate combat droids from the previous game - considering depth it is a little bit further from the initial game concept (the very first UFO game from the '90s) than the predecessor - taking covers seems to be totally random, feels that it has no effect on defense (in this mean tactics are closer to the initial game from the '90s) - some aspects feel not to be balanced well - in my opinion the expansions don't add to the gameplay that much as Enemy Within of the first game  I have mixed feelings but at the end of the day, I'm rather on the positive side. X-COM 2 improved the variety much that made combat missions less predictable - yet there are less options of modding the function / role of soldiers (no mech and aug options). In a way it feels to be reduced a little. It is true than it is a guerilla way of winning the war against a vastly bigger foe with limited resources that is cool - still, X-COM EU has a better feel of the pressure somehow and more options during preparation. Anyway, if the game was about combat missions only, I think X-COM 2 would win. Players who like more predictable combats would choose X-COM EU I guess.  Is it a good game? Yes, after all. Is it fun? Definitely. Did it meet my expectations? More or less. Is it better than the first game? I liked X-COM EU more.  Would I recommend it? Regardless of bugs and old feats I miss, I'd say yes.",1,0

3240398,270850,Car Mechanic Simulator 2014,"This game could be a very enjoyable casual simulation, if not for the extremely clunky controls. The lack of keyboard customization and hot-keys for common tasks, along with having to constantly reach for the 'esc' key, make the game a chore to play. I shouldn't be difficult to implement these changes, and the fact that they haven't been is pretty annoying. I'll hold off on recommending this game until the developers refine the interface.",-1,0
3241187,270880,American Truck Simulator,"so i just have to ask this... where are the rest of the states?

3241396,270880,American Truck Simulator,"Well, I've spent far too much of my time on this game following its release.  tl;dr: Euro Truck Simulator 2 is still a better value, and likely to go on a very cheap sale sooner and more often. ATS is slightly more technically advanced and detailed, but has less content.  So why did I thumb this up?  To understand why, it might be more fair to compare this game to the ETS2: Scandinavia DLC release. It was in Scandinavia that SCS started really putting this level of love and beauty into the visual environment, and ATS seems to incorporate most or all of the under-the-hood upgrades ETS2 has gotten, as of Scandinavia. I would also tend to say Scandinavia holds less overall content. That all aside, I'll go into a list of positive and negative things about this game, as I've encountered them thus far.  Positive:  +UPDATED: The multiplayer mod is available.  +UPDATED: The trucks and trailers are both larger than in ETS2, which can introduce new challenges in driving and tight-space maneuvering.  +UPDATED: Trucks come with insurance when you purchase them, reducing the cost of repairs substantially. This element of gameplay simply wasn't present in ETS2, where you would simply pay the entirety of every repair bill on your own vehicle.  +The environment is wonderful! I'm especially pleased with the design of the urban areas, which feature places that just feel more like downtown and residential areas than anything in ETS2 or ETS2: Going East, where almost everything is an industrial district or shipping yard. San Francisco in particular was lovely.  +Trailers just feel like they have more real inertia than in ETS2. Or maybe the default braking strength is just weaker; I'm quite pleased either way.  +The new parking system is well-presented and gives real options for new, intermediate, and more advanced drivers.  +The interface and controls may not have been changed substantially from ETS2 to ATS, but that's a good thing! The ETS2 interface was clean and very well-presented; there's no need to fix what isn't broken.  +The system for hiring new drivers, giving them trucks, and letting them make money for you does not appear to have changed substantially from ETS2, except for the payouts feeling smaller. Again, this is a good thing--the system worked well in ETS2, and it works well here.  +The traffic density is quite good. It's high enough to make the roads feel alive, but not high enough to make them feel congested.  +E-Pass toll booths!  +The economy feels a bit 'tougher' than the economy in ETS2. What you pay for things hasn't changed, but job payouts feel like they've gone down a fair bit. You may also take this as a negative thing if that's not to your taste.  +Fuel tanks are smaller, starting out, and simply don't last as long. This combines with weight station and rest stops (if you play with fatigue enabled) to produce a higher-maintenance experience without, at the same time, being particularly obtrusive. This could also be taken as a negative thing, if it's not to your taste.  +Due to incorporation of ETS2's interface and engine, the game was mod-ready on day one.  +It doesn't really feel all that sparse on content, and knowing that the first couple of states added (including Nevada, included with launch) will probably be free patches instead of paid DLC is consoling.  +A broader camera range within the cab enables a better view of the sleeper than is available in ETS2. This isn't much, but hey, a plus is a plus.  +It's only US$20, cheaper even than ETS2 and 1/3 the price of most new releases.    Negative:  -You get what you pay for. The content is, as others have said, a touch on the small and sparse side. There isn't all that much land. There are only two trucks, with almost no variety - even the engines are the same, and they sound identical. The only reason to pick one truck over the other is its price (the Peterbilt is cheaper) and cabin aesthetics (I prefer the Kenworth). This could, indeed, be understood as an official mod to ETS2 with no attachment points to the earlier game.  UPDATED -- There are now three trucks. The new Kenworth W900 looks and sounds very different, as it should (being an older model IRL). The W900 also feels quite different to drive due in the main to size differences.  -Framerates feel a little less stable on my mediocre system (OC'd G3258, OC'd Radeon 7770 GHz Ed., 8GB @1333MHz DDR3) than on ETS2. It seems related to the higher volume of traffic, especially downtown (and at night, when there are so many more light sources to map out).  -I had a bug shortly after starting the tutorial mission where the game paused on a black screen, and would not unpause. I had to kill the game and restart, but never had the issue again. That could indicate some small technical issues.  Not covered:  -I do not have a wheel and pedals, and can't speak for that element of the simulator experience.  -I do not drive a truck IRL, and can't speak for the driving element of the simulator experience. -I haven't been this far west in the United States, and can't speak for the accuracy of the landscape.   Overall, I like this game, and I'd like to see more of it. I don't regret buying it, but right now, ETS2 is the better value, and more likely to be on sale for less money - although without the DLC, it doesn't really have the beauty and variety you'll find in Scandinavia and in ATS. If you want better value for your money (better, because I'm not going to say this is bad value for the money), buy ETS2 and maybe the major expansion packs. If you really like driving in the United States or put a disproportionately high value on aesthetics, try this game.",1,0

3291105,271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"~Mixed Review~ (So has to get a thumbs down)  -The Good- 1. Game looks good 2. The TPS elements aren't bad 3. Has the general GTA feel.   -The Bad- 1. Driving is often sloppy due to 'character 'skillz.'' - Pretty huge component of a GTA game could have just left this stat out altogether. Car handling would have been ample enough. 2. Characters fit typified stereotypes.   -The Ugly- (Everything below, I would consider PRETTY ♥♥♥♥ING BASIC DESIGN ELEMENTS FOR GAMES) 1. No Defaults for user preference settings (e.g. Racing - NO RADIO STATION) - it doesn't even care to remember your previous settings.  2. Automatically defaults you into populated lobbies after a job. If I wanted to be in a populated server I WOULD HAVE SELECTED IT FROM THE START! 3. Single Player: Required DRM (Is this still working out for anyone? Apart from steam.) 4. Friendlist is less than intuitive. While I get they want you to manage things with your phone. It would make sense to have those options that don't tie directly to YOUR CHARACTER but your account in the game over menu. (Your element is in the wrong spot!) A good compromise would to have it in both locations. How’s about integrating it with already existing systems, I dunno like friends on steam. &gt;.&gt; 5. Pay2Win... How about Um... NO?  6.

3292250,271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"This is not a GTA game. It is fun in the same way skyrim is fun. But like skyrim, it completely misses the point of the game series. (except you cant mod out the problems without getting banned)  The world of Los Santos, besides being nothing like the Los Santos in San Andreas, feels by comparison unoriginal, empty and a really pathetic excuse for a sandbox game. The exploration of the world has been replaced with GPS and tedious mission ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is at an all time high... but at least I can drive a lawnmower off a skyscraper - right?...   The radio (one of the best features of the GTA series) is a shadow of it's former glory, the radio dosen't do anything to set the theme of the game, because the theme is a parody of present day, except it beats you over the head. The artstyle gives no favours, as rockstar turned the realism dial way up.  100% completion is more like a 'you gave it a go - have a cookie' type deal. No side missions of any importance, the game is hardly rewarding, money is difficult to come by, so you cant enjoy the (exceptionally boring) businesses you can buy until the final mission, at which point, why bother?

3293996,271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"Review Date: 12/19/2015 There are two aspects to this game:  1. Single Player This is just what you expect from a R* title, and more. The environment is great, the story is great, and is light years ahead of GTA IV (mainly because it brought back a lot of elements from San Andreas). Rockstar does update the game with new features every few months, but unforutinely they do not get incorporated into single player. Even some core features from multiplayer, such as the car insurance just incase your vehicle gets destroyed, are missing in single player.  2. Multi Player When this game first came out, it was a great experience. Since the low-riders update in late October 2015, this game has been infested with hackers/modders/'script kiddies'/or whatever you choose to call them. Each multiplayer lobby has at least a few. The anti-cheat is a joke, and from what I read its as simple as replacing a few files in the directory. Some say to find a crew or play in 'invite only' lobbies, but I feel I shouldn't have to do such things to enjoy a game. From a modern title, I find this problematic especially when people are now taking it upon themselves to mod themselves to combat other modders, OR just leave the game entirely.  Conclusion The single player game is a great ride and well worth the price of admission. Multiplayer is a big let down, considering its potential. Overall, I would have to NOT RECOMMEND this product as a whole of single player &amp; multiplayer due to the hacking in multiplayer and the lack of features offered in multiplayer that havent been translated to single player (the car insurance, low-riders, yachts, and so on).  I, personally, still play this game despite the problems. I have a good group of friends/crew to play with, but if I didn't I would have uninstalled this game long ago. At the time of this review, I have about 450 hours of game time.",-1,0

Now I'm not laughing becuase I realize that all those people were 100% correct and I should've listened, why didn't I listen? You will search far and wide in hopes of finding a lobby where nobody is running scripts, and your searches will be in vain. You will settle for a lobby in which whoever is running scripts isn't bothering you, and that will never be for long. The worst part about this is, that half of the community worships thse scripters like God-kings, because of either '1337 trolling skillz m8', 'lol ebin random Xd', or are so thirsty for in-game cash they're willing to put up with whatever ♥♥♥♥ is thrown at them in the hopes a dollar or two is thrown their way.

While running the benchmark test, on the games default graphic settings, it shows that I am getting 90+ fps constantly; but every second or two, there is a 'stutter' in the framerate which pauses the framerate by a half a second or so.

I bought this game after it came out for PC as an upgrade from my PS3 version. Graphics are crisp and beautiful, the story is excellent with tons of extras after you finish the main storyline. My problem is with the Rockstar Social Club, and their TERRIBLE service. They will not respond to countless emails I have sent to them about how their Social Club launcher will not let me play my game, if this was one of the cheaper less new games I probably would not be so passionate about this, but for this I feel completely jipped, and ripped off. My experience with Rockstar has been one with months of not being able to play the game I spent a lot of money on, and after this awful experience I will more than likely be searching for other games to spend my little amount of time one. Social Club is complete garbage and I'm shocked that such a well respected company treats their customers in this manner.

3299383,271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"I haven't played much of GTA 5, it is good so far.  The thing I don't like is GTA Online, which is the reason why I bought it. This mode has no proper matchmaking.  In the Hiests, if someone disconnects or times-out, then everybody has to start the hiest again.... but it's not as simple as restarting, everybody has to rejoin the heist, which takes time.  Joining a mission can take up to 5 minutes. You can wait another 20 minutes for other people to join because the matchmaking is terrible. If you join 1 with people that are higher level than you, they will most likely boot you. so you spend another 3 minutes loading back into GTA online. From there you can choose whether to try to join another game and wait another 5 minutes.  I have played it for about 60 hours so far, and I know that a at least 2 hours of that is spent at loading screens.  Another 2 hours is spent waiting for players to join.

3301185,271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"Overall good things: - Graphics are superb! Even if I'm not able to play on ultra settings, this game looks really great - Voice acting is triple A - I really liked the story. It's simple, but I liked it. - I like all the small details they put in this game, soundwise or visually - You're absolutely free to do as you please - I like the small missions, where you're witness to a robbery and being able to pursue the robber and bring the stolen goods back - I like the city / level design - Game runs very solid, didn't crash once - The menu is tidied up and I found everything the first time. Thanks for that. - I can switch between XBox-Controller and mouse/keyboard input seemlessly. That's great, because I use the controller for driving / walking around and mouse/keyboard for shooting - Thank you VERY much for being able to skip a mission after I fail it three times. Game makers, take note! For me as probably the most horrible gamer out there, I'm very thankful for that. - The variety of the missions - So far, I thought the automatic safe points in missions are very fair, even for my horrible gaming skills - Headshots are deadly. Thanks for that! Also, the hitboxes are quite good.  Things I don't judge: - The music. I turned it off immediately, because I only listen to my own music. - GTA Online. I have a life besides video gaming, so I never played it online and can't tell something about it. And while reading other reviews, I think it's still the right decision, because Rockstar Games is not interested in doing anything against hackers.   Things that ruin that game for me: - Cars keep disappearing, even when stored in the garage. I already searched the forums and it seems that Rockstar Games doesn't care. Stealing and hording cars is fundamental in such a game for me, but when it's not working, I'm no longer interested. - I once read that this game's production cost about 100 million dollars. For what? FOR WHAT? Did they invest 99 millions solely in music licenses? - Driving is absolutely horrible and no fun at all. I know this is a more arcade driving experience, but so is Need For Speed, and NFS just nails it. Every car and bike is absolutely glued to the street and the handling is so awful it's frustrating and no fun at all. - Speaking of the cars, the sound of the cars is plain terrible. Every car sounds the same and absolutely lame. From all the money they invested in this game, weren't they able to pay a sound designer to record a V8 sound? Ridiculous, if you ask me. - No real cars. Weren't they able to get some real licenses?  I really tried to like this game, but the lack of fundamental things like driving are just too awful too ignore. It's not easier to make a 'Recommended' out of this, as somehow GTA5 stopped working. First it was some kind of 'ERR GFX D3D INIT error', now it just goes to blank. Rockstar doesn't give a nickel about solving this problem, and every solution I tried after reading dozens of forums doesn't help.",-1,0

It is a short game, i have finished most of it other than the last level/world that won't unlock without grinding better times. I played 90 minutes without the locked content so the game offers maybe 2 hours of content.  I can't recommend the game because of technical problems. Sometimes the game just crashes, sometimes the ninja just keeps running to the right or left for no reason, sometimes the gamepad inputs just stop working.

3303239,271900,Hexcells Plus,"Highly recommend this game. The levels are designed in such a way that you never have to guess; what makes it better is that there are usually multiple avenues towards solving each given level. If you're finding it too difficult to solve one area of (solvable, but tricky) hexes, it's often the case that you can make progress in a separate area before returning with a little more information.   I would have liked to see some more content, but it was cool how the game kept with the hexagon theme. 6 worlds with 6 levels each. (Though admittedly, a few of the levels were filler / instructional, and didn't pose as much of a challenge.) I wonder if an optional timed mode would be a good idea. On the one hand, it would be nice to come back to the levels in a few months and see how fast I solve them second time around, but on the other hand, the pressure might take away from the uncluttered minimalist feel of the game.   Overall, thorougly enjoyed Hexcells &amp; Hexcells Plus and would definitely recommend as a stimulating challenge.",1,0
3304466,272060,Serena,"Serena is a simple and free click-and-point adventure game, the adventure of size of log cabin and of lenght of hour at most. As you can guess, it's a dark story with no clear objective, just hero trying to remember his life with wife by searching there. No worries, there are no jumpscares. You navigate through the log cabin by pointing and clicking and then search various items by pointing and clicking too, resulting in main character commenting on them, most of comments being linked to his wife - Serena.  The game itself is supposed to be like a 'tutorial' for upcoming developer's title 'Asulym', mostly showing multiple character's reaction on objects. Each time that you click on the object, it will bring yet another character's thought, until it starts to loop in more generic lines. As the game progresses and overall mood of scene changes, each object will awake a different kind of thoughts in hero's mind with a different mood flavor. It's also told that this game is 'disturbing love letter' to adventure genre fans, that this game happened because of events that most of you didn't notice.  While the progression is not clear and is rather washed out, it does exist. There is no puzzle, you just have to explore log cabin and click-click-click it all. My hint would be to recheck photo on table from time to time. The story is not exactly clear, and most is told to be open for impretation. There is only one ending. The usual kind. For 'art' games. You know them.  There really isn't much to say about graphics and music, just your standard fare. And there is no menu, ESC button kicks you out. So there are chances that some people will have technical difficulties.  The game is free and shouldn't waste too much of your free time, so you can easily check this out.

It still plays well, there have been no issues with online play, and there are a variety of available resolutions. Just don't expect this game to justify a PC upgrade or anything.   The game currenlty suffers from severe balance issues that were not really present during the open beta. Why the devs decided to change so much in the wrong direction is an interesting question. Many of the hunters offer no advantage to the more popular picks, some of poor to the point where they will set your team at a severe disadvantage. Decent monster players are capable of killing your entire team at level 2 in one go without great difficulty, which they really shouldn't be.  This game would be great but the above issues really hold it back. Hopefully a patch or new DLC may bring this game back to the hype that it should have had.  If the game were 30.00 dollars versus 60.00 then we would have a good buy. But considering the balance issues and lack of content currently I would recommend a pass. However, it is good enough that if you have already purchased it, or have a group of friends to play with, it is still worth your time. Future patches or expansions may make this game from a average game to a great game.",-1,1
3318387,273350,Evolve Stage 2,Fun for the first game to third one. Then you realise that every game is the exact same that the charactors have as much differnce as the grass in your front yard. At most they just look differnt or do the same thing in a slightly differnt way.  Edit: this is for the beta. i have played as monster and human and i have to say. they sucked any life fun or appeal out of this game like a vampire in a blood bank. the monster now with certain combos of perks can be invincable and i do mean 100% invincable the humans feel like they mine as well be throwing rocks at the monster. the 'training' isnt training you for anything. its just a bot match with a new name. the game went from 'meh' to '♥♥♥♥' in one update. some how by making it free to play and 'adding more' they took all the fun out of it.,-1,1
3318822,273350,Evolve Stage 2,"Before F2P: The game was quite decent a bit long Queue times but the game seemed worth the money with a very solid concept. After i purchased it i wasnt disapointed at all.  The monster designs are great, the sounds are great and the gameplay is refreshing.  After F2p went live: So after playing as the Wraith for 1 round i have to say not much changed. I may have lost because i didnt know i have to destroy the power relay BUT i had a lot of fun using decoy and the empower ability to utterly decimate anyone following me.  Although i think anyone now being able to use the dome kinda is meh and the dome itself lasts a bit too long and recharges too fast but i guess that's just me as someone who'll mainly play monster.

3319071,273350,Evolve Stage 2,"As much as I would want to like this game, I just dont.  After 69 hours on launch and even more on Big Alpha &amp; Closed Beta I have to say that do not buy this game. Why? - Numerous bugs (affecting mostly the monster play) - Low map pool - Low interactivity - Poor balance on hunters (tier 4 is op and unenjoyable to face) - Poor balance between monsters - Some of the maps are way too punishing for certain monsters - Map designation done priorly thinking of Goliath - The game can be such a snore-fest most of the time - The patching takes a long time (meaning how often the devs patches this game, even though it is in dire need of it)  This game certainly does have it's high moments. But the good moments are way too rare. The game does look good, but the mechanics are flawed (especially on monster).  This game can and will cause huge amount of frustration and little sense of achievement.  Do I have to mention the price of 'DLC' on this game? oh my, that is just... horrendous.  Do not buy this game, buy something else. You will be much happier.",-1,0

3319604,273350,Evolve Stage 2,I like this game but as i have played it and as the patches have come out one buy one i have realized that this is a game buy hunters for hunters. The monster is just an obsticle and a form of delay for the hunters to get there xp and level up there skills. The monster dont really stand a chanse against any team of hunters that play together as a team. The monster dont really stand a chanse against a good hunter team. And the game have imo bin more and more balanced to favor the hunters. And thats why i only play solo against ai. I dont hate this game and its a game thats the most fun with friends. And i have had much fun playing it. So i could vote like but i dont like it that the devs only favor the hunters and the monsters never really stand a chance so im afraid i have to give this a no and that makes me a bit sad tbh and i dont really want to but i feel that i have to.,-1,0
3320018,273350,Evolve Stage 2,"In a nutshell, it's a machine to sell DLC.  From afar, Evolve seems like a good game. Visually pretty appealing, the concept interesting and well crafted. There just aren't a lot of asymmetrical games out that play well. Evolve, for at least the first bit of time you play it, certainly does play well. There's a lot of polish in it. The problem is that it missed the mark on what would be necessary to keep it fun for a long time. It feels like the entire game was just engineered to try and convince you DLC is what will keep it fun, rather than having unique or engaging experiences.  I think given that it's Turtle Rock, it's relevant to compare this game to Left 4 Dead. In Left 4 Dead's versus mode, the survivors goal is escaping to safety. It's getting from A to B alive. Even without the special infected, they're inhibited by the environment and the common infected. The player-controlled common infected have a goal of stopping and slowing them by any means. In Evolve, more often than not the direct goal is for players on both sides to go after the other players. Sure, the monster has alternative goals, but most of the time their primary goal is just simply running and hiding until they can get strong enough to fight the hunters. The strategy is always the same. The hunters are constantly chasing the monster, most often fighting their own lack of mobility rather than the actual environment. The monster is always trying to get far enough away to eat and evolve. Every match has its entire process boiled down to those elements and it gets old very quickly.   The issue isn't so much a lack of progression or even that the DLC exists, it's that the game just fundamentally loses its luster due to a complete lack of variety or dynamism. Where you can go to an asymmetrical game like Left 4 Dead today and still have fun seeing people employ a host of different strategies in versus mode, you mostly just see people trying to exploit every single thing they can in Evolve just to break out of the repetitious bore that the gameplay offers. Then when you throw on top of that how every bit of the game that could even begin to add variety is behind some kind of a paywall? Well that really makes it a bad purchase. DLC should not ever at any point be a hammer to smash fun into a game, it should be an addition that takes something good and spices it up. People should like the game so much they're willing to pay to get more rather than pay more to get what they originally wanted.",-1,0

You ask the waiter 'Excuse me, where is the rest of my pizza?', and the waiter responds 'Oh, for the next slice you need to pay for a Pizza DLC pack or Pizza Topping Ultra DLC pack if you want the toppings as well. Oh, also you can pay for the rest of your pizza alltogether, but it will cost you another full pizza price.'  Thanks, but no thanks. I'll wait on a sale where the game is what it's worth.

3322777,273350,Evolve Stage 2,"This game is basically a console port with bad controls and hud/menu for pc gamers. The final release actually runs worse than the beta/alpha. I can't play multiplayer without the game crashing a couple minutes in and even if I try to rejoin my friends immediately the player slot has already been filled by the matchmaking system... great. Also this game seems to be very much lacking in content. There are only 3 monsters and 3 hunters per class and all this content can be unlocked in just a few hours of gameplay, leaving nothing new past the first few hours of playtime. This is made worse by the fact that there is nothing in the game we haven't already seen and experienced in the beta. There is absolutely nothing new since the beta, which had hardly anything new from the alpha. The devs are clearly holding back content so they can charge us for it later with DLC and you can expect a lot of it with this game.  Basically, if you played the beta then you have seen everything the final version of this game has to offer. You decide if it is worth the price. Also, the 'singleplayer' mode to this game is just you playing with only bots. This game is designed to be played online with the community only, and when that community dies out so will this game.  UPDATE: I wrote the above review after my initial playtime with the final release of the game and before the whole hate storm that is currently going on in the steam reviews for this game. I had not even seen the insane list of DLC available for this game on release. This is just a joke. I bought the full blown monster edition of this game thinking that is what it would take to get all the content of this game. I did not realize the developers were planning on releasing a mountain on day one DLC that is just a bunch of crap that should have been in the final game and charging as much as $7.99 for a texture? Are you ♥♥♥♥ing kidding me? I knew they were planning on charging for hunters and monsters, but I had no idea they were so greedy they feel it's OK to charge $15 a piece. I was dumb enough to buy the $100 version of this game but the only people who are still defending this as a great game and don't mind the DLC have more money than sense. Most developers spend two years working on a game and then charge you $60 for the whole game, or all the work they did up to that point and only charging money for new content (DLC) they made post development of the core game. Turtle Rock and 2K Games have decided to charge us the same $60 but are not selling us the whole game or all the work they did over the last two years, they want us to pay an additional $85 for that. What a ♥♥♥♥ing joke.",-1,1

There is a nice learning curve from the easy to hard levels, its very fun and I love the retro look. Will be playing this one a lot, and can not wait to play more. I want the Afro character in the trailer... he looks mint.  I recommend everyone buys this game reminds me of crash bandicoot, mario and even super meat boy. Very happy with my purchase.   ",1,0

Your character moves sluggishly through the most uninspired levels I've ever seen. Stones materializes out of thin air right above you and insta-kills you. This is the kind of video game that makes people violent, and for all the wrong reason. It's just soooo frustatingly crappy!

3359935,275850,No Man's Sky,"((( I shouldn't even be reviewing this with the gameplay time I have. I don't really think 16 hours is enough to fully review this game, however I'd just like to add my brief opinion on my experience so far... )))   This game is pretty much what I've been waiting for in terms of gameplay, I knew what I was expecting once I hyped myself up a couple years back watching E3. When gameplay started leaking prior to the final release, I was ready for the game. The fact that I'm able to explore an open universe, with an insane amount of Stars is awesome. Others may not agree, however, I find it fascinating.   I've discovered a little over 10 planets, and so far about 3 Systems, or 4? I can't remember right now. All of them have been pretty exotic in terms of survival. I've been through numerous Planets with little to no life whatsoever. Some have been hard to scavenge resources as I was too early to upgrade my suit in able survive some Planets.  Upgrading my suit to be able to withstand toxic/hazardous planets is also very helpful, mostly for what I described above.  The ability to upgrade my ship is helpful, let alone search for abandoned ships as well.   Uploading my discoveries is also a neat feature, however I lack creativity to name every single thing I find.  Space combat is interesting, I won't praise it but again, it was never the main feature of the game. So far I've died once to Space Pirates as I couldn't keep up at all. Other times I've luckily been able to defend myself off from 1 or 2 Pirates, and there was one experience where I was able to escape into a nearby Planet. I found that pretty cool, but frustrating in terms of almost dying!  The dialogue and 'Story' from alien species and even ancient ruins is a bit interesting. I've come upon some hilarious reactions, and also intimidating responses. The ancient history seems pretty rough as well, just a small aspect I enjoy.   In the end, there was a few things that bother me, however there's much more praise from me than negativity. I will keep exploring and learning more about this game. I've yet to even try to get close to the center, I'm much more interested in getting my Star Ship ready for hyperdriving to further Galaxies. So far I'm really enjoying this game, and while I'd rather have paid less than $60, I can't be too upset for the amount of time I've played so far.   8/10 for me, however this could change down the road so I guess I'll see as I keep playing.",1,0

3365192,275850,No Man's Sky,I like it and ill tell you why. Nms has smaller elements of some of my favorite games. Its like you took starbound and elite dangerous and mixxed them together and then lifted the froth off the top. Nms is that froth. It doesnt have the meatiest game mechanics but instead it does offer a large variety of unpredictable elements. You literally never know what you might run into out here in space.,1,0
3365196,275850,No Man's Sky,"Sound idea but poorly executed. The excitement felt for exploring the galaxy and discovering new aliens and planets soon wore off after I realised that most of my time would be spent grinding for materials just to keep myself alive. Also worth mentioning is that this game promoted itself upon exploring planets which are unique and different form one another due to randomisation, however randomisation can only get you so far, and without new textures, planets get old real fast. Don't get me wrong, I like the game, and I'll most likely play it when I'm looking for a slow-paced game when I'm feeling stressed out, but I simply cannot justify paying around $80 AUD for this game in it's current state.  TLDR: Much too expensive for what you're getting at this point in time, buy it when it's on sale if you wanna check it out.",1,0
3365638,275850,No Man's Sky,To everyone that says 'The game is terrible because it crashes/lags/terrible frames' let me explain something to you. It is your rig. You need to update parts. My personal rig is i3 8gb gtx970. If it is worse than that idk. For me all i get is screen tear for some reason even though i have a 144hrz monitor and frame drops because i have a crappy cpu. Besides the facts about how it runs the game itself isnt that great but improvements can happen. Like multiplayer (no mans lie) and more understanding story. I stopped playing after 2.4 hrs cause just exploring and destroying rocks isnt that fun. Otherwise flying is pretty fun and that is really it.

3377082,275850,No Man's Sky,"This game is absurdly overpriced. Sean Murray CLEARLY lied about numerous features that were not included in the game. All you do in this game is explore and obtain resources. That's literally it. That would be enough, maybe, if all planets didn't play out exactly the same way. Hot/Cold/Toxic/Radiated, they all are the same. Those factors don't change anything. The life on it will vary, but even creatures are the same besides looks. Few will 'attack' you but they're rare and are easily killed/avoided. Planets have cosmetic differences but all have the same general resources available aside from some that have special things like 'poison sacs' that can be harvested and sold. Some rare variety would have been fantastic, something like really rarely finding a small civ on a planet in the stone age or something. But no, there's nothing besides numerous outposts with on alien sitting in a chair not moving.  Ship customizing hardly exists, they all operate the same way in combat. There isn't 'classes' as we were told.  There are no factions. The 'intelligent' life in the game you come across has literally have no effect on the game at all. They occassionally give you a blueprint for a tech you probably don't need or want if you answer their vague ramblings with the correct response. It would have been awesome to see actual life in giant space stations other than one alien sitting in a chair.   The galaxy doesn't feel alive. Planets don't rotate around their stars as we were told.  I won't spoil the ending, but I will say I have no idea at all how they thought that it would be satisfying or players would enjoy it. None at all. It's as if they didn't even test it on people outside of their 15 strong development team. There's no way anybody, even the biggest supporters, like the ending. It's absurd.  This game could have been great. Most people probably would have been okay with it if it had the price of a normal indie game of $20-30. $60 is entirely too much and I can't recommend it at all.",-1,0

3378984,275850,No Man's Sky,"Well i played the game without watching the Trailer but knowing what I have to expect... At first it was quite intresting and fun to play and I really thought it might be a great game. After a few hours I started to realize it's just doing the same stuff over and over again. Scanning the same creatures with just small changes in their appearance... or rocks and plants that look exactly the same. Sadly there isn't any motivation to continue playing once you've realized that. Furthermore there isn't really anything to achieve that you can be proud of. It's just a lonely adventure that continues to become increasingly boring. It's really great to have an almost endless amount of (boring) planets to explore with just small variations since you've soon seen everything somewhere before. Therefore the point what should make this game great... is one of it's greatest weaknesses!  Up to this point I was just upset. But since I've watched the trailer I feel just deceived. There are so many great features shown in the Trailer that makes you wanna play the game that is shown THERE! What you get by buying the game... is in my opinion just a early unfinished version of the game in the Trailer. It doesn't even feel like it's the same game.   I'd say the game that you can buy now, isn't worth buying for that price. I really can't recommend buying it - you'll just feel deceived and disappointed.

3378987,275850,No Man's Sky,"I stopped playing this game when discoveries I had made started becoming lost. This game is a perfect example of great expectations and ambitions without the followthrough. I have withheld leaving a review till now. Today I was reading that the moderators shut down the subredit.  This game wanted to be great. It wanted to have so much. It wanted to be the Indie space game that rivaled the likes of Elite Dangerous and Star Citizen. It was capable of being very good and coming close to meeting the above goal. But the developers, through use of false advertisement and underacheievement, misled gamers regarding the scope of the product that was to be released. Sadly, instead of achieving what could have been they chose to release what was nothing near what should have been.  Post-release they have continued to downplay and shrug off criticism. Rather than taking criticism as a thought for improvement, the devs have completely rejected the idea. Further proof of that comes with the action taken to shut down the subredit calling it 'a hate filled wastehole of no actual discussion' - r0ugew0lf (subredit moderator whose actions are backed by the devs). I can totally understand ignoring what would be considered deconstructive criticism but I personally found a lot of useful information in that subredit when I was playing the game. Shutting it down is now another example of failure on the devs part; failure to listen to those who should matter most: your customers.  Don't waste your time with this game. Don't waste your time with this company. There is no reason to support this company, this product or any other product that this company puts out.

3382162,275850,No Man's Sky,"Nope I do not recommend this game. Repetitive, boring and not immersive at all. By playing a couple hours of this game you have experienced the whole game. The developers tried to implement elements to keep you interested and wanting to play more but how its executed, its very dull and stale.  The game was fun for a couple of hours. Everything was fresh and new. When I began to dig deeper into the game I realized it was already repeating itself and I wasn't even that far in the game yet. My experience from playing the game. You have to find these Signal Scanners, to have access to these Scanners you need to craft a Bypass Chip. Upon inserting it into the Scanner, it gives you access to 4 different signals which consist of  - Monolith (Alien Cultural Locations) - Colonial Outpost (Operation Centres) - Transmission (Scans for Beacons and Transmission Towers)  - Shelter (Shelters and Drop Pods)  Now to find anything of value using these Signal Scanners are crucial. Unless you would rather fly around the planet(s) aimlessly looking for these key locations. This is where the game became really tedious. To move at a decent pace this is the only option. I found myself using the Signal Scanner and flying back and forth to these locations attempting to get a better ship/better equipment. I lost interest very quickly in the process of doing so. I had no desire to fly around the planet(s) looking for these locations when using the Scanner is clearly faster and more efficient. This is where I realized how unstimulating the game had become, a rinse and repeat effect. People said you need to explore the planets more, experience the glory and atmospheric vibe since apparently this is what this game is all about.. I never got any of that when playing. To be completely honest the planet(s) were very shallow and plain looking, the WHOLE procedurally generated thing turned out to not be all that great. All planets ended up to be the same, they change in color in terms of the ground, rocks and some have water some don't, its nothing astonishing. The only thing that was a little bit cool was different plants and creature life but even that was uninspiring. Overall the planets were very lackluster, they felt the same. I was hoping for more diversity.  Final thoughts, the game isn't worth the $60 dollar price tag at all. Maybe $25-$30? If you really are considering picking up this game I would wait till a sale 50% off. The game is lacking in content, not to mention all future DLC was suppose to be free for this game.   'You've paid for the game, so you should get this stuff without paying even more money. So no, there will be no paid DLC, just patches.' - Sean Murray  Now there is a high possibility that will change, but we will see.   I do not recommend this game at all, honestly its a super cool concept but I felt we were handed a bunch of lies after the game had launched. The games performance on launch was horrid, from crashing, FPS drops, massive stuttering and options that weren't even working or implemented. I patiently waited till the beta patch rolled out and that fixed the stuttering but game still ran horribly. No game should be launched in that current state. The developers knew what they were doing and how poorly it ran they just decided to launch it anyways, there is no way issues like that go unnoticed. I am writing this review as of August 21st 2016. Performance may have changed. Regardless, I would pass on this game, from the issues with performance to lacking immersion, the game isn't worth the majority of YOUR guys time especially not for the price.",-1,0

3384062,276810,Mordheim: City of the Damned,"Turn-based squad strategy RPG in the Warhammer (not 40k!) universe. Very grimdark, lots of gruff voice actors trying super hard. If you've played any game in either Warhammer or 40k you know what I'm talking about.  The game is very atmospheric, but extremely light on story. 90% of your missions will be randomly generated, and of those I never saw one that presented something new or interesting. Just a cobbled-together mash of buildings, hallways, and annoying dead ends. Randomization adds very little to the game, only changing the map and team spawn points. The mission is always to simply kill everyone on the other team, or deal enough morale damage to get them to rout.  Typical for the genre, chance plays an enormous role in the outcome of your missions. Because this is so gritty and realistic (a 'hardcore experience' as the game puts it) your guys will get knocked out, often, to things you could not possibly prevent. Party members who fall in combat have a chance to die instantly, or receive a permanent debilitating injury. To me, that's as good as them being dead. I'm not carting around some guy with -25% move speed who can't climb over walls for the rest of the game.  So, obviously you don't want that. Any party member who's left alone can and will be killed in one turn if he encounters 2 enemies, or one powerful one. I found the most effective, and boring, strategy was to thus keep my whole team in arm's reach of each other at all times. The game has no time limit mechanics so there's really no reason to not play that way.  Lots of little annoying things too. The tutorial system is ♥♥♥♥. Information is vomited on the screen, literally dozens of statistics that no normal human could parse meaningful decisions out of. Enemy turns go by at a snail's pace, even with 'Speed up enemy turns' checked. Eventually I just had my phone out for the inexplicable 45+ seconds of enemy turns that I couldn't even see because of fog of war. There's no *sell all* button for your resources. Traps litter the floor of the map but you can see them with the naked eye so they're pretty obnoxious 'gotchas' more than anything deadly or interesting.  Nothing I've ♥♥♥♥♥ed about here, by itself, makes Mordheim unplayable, but together, it's really unfun. I don't even mind the RNG sometimes screwing you over; I played XCOM on Ironman mode because I enjoy that thrill of not knowing what could happen. So a game that forces that upon you seems like it'd be right up my alley.   I really wanted to like this game! That's why I stuck with it for as long as I did, despite the flaws.

3384800,276810,Mordheim: City of the Damned,"Amazing game, and even though i am going to downvote this i will keep playing cause i spent 40 bucks on it.  The games great, gameplay is amazing. Sure it lacks some customization in places and other stuff such as only a few factions. The real problem the percentages.   90% chance to hit target. Misses everytime. You surround a enemy they dodge every hit then slowly kill you off and you lose. I've experienced ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t situations like this many many times and i will kep experiencing them. The percentage system is not based on luck there has to be some underline ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t programing in there that puts all luck on the AI's side. Its honestly mind killing when you have such a good game infront of you but you cannot get anywhere.

3387821,277460,Praetorians,"This game, is balls. In a good way.  I had this game since it came out, about 2003 or 2004, and if it wasn't because the CD ended up useless after using it too much, I would probably still play the original version, and have not bought this one. But dude, at THIS price, how to say 'no'? Less than 1€ for this? But you probably don't know crap about it, do you? I won't judge for that, actually!  Praetorians is an Spanish strategy game, from the old, old times. Because it was made ONLY in Spanish, the English version was kind of rushed, that being one of the biggest problems of the game: Holy ♥♥♥♥, the English voices suck so hard, I rather call GG and ragequit from life. If you're Spanish, you can just install a patch to put the good Spanish voices, but if you're not...Learn Spanish, or get ear-♥♥♥♥♥, I guess. The other main issue with this game, is the fact that was build to work on Windows XP, back when it was mainstream. That means you will have some problems, unless you check in the game files, and set the .exe file of the game to run as it was on Windows XP. Not a big deal, but unless you do it, your game will look corrupted as ♥♥♥♥, with black textures, and stuff like that. The last bad thing about this game, is that the original servers are loooooooong gone. Fear not, though. Lan still works just fine, and there are ways to play online, one of them, and probably the best one, being GameRanger...Or whatever that thing is called, haven't tested it yet, but I will (if I find anything wrong with it, I will edit this part of the Review). Now that the bad stuff of the game, I can just go along and tell you about the rest.  But hey, is the actual game any good? Holy ♥♥♥♥, it is. Have you played other strategy games? Warcraft III? Age of Empires? Starcraft? In most strategy games, you spend an awful lot of time getting resources: Wood, gold, food, all kinds of stuff, right? WELL F#CK THAT, WE ARE GOING REALISTIC HERE. Praetorians was one of those games that decided to f#ck da police, and do something diferent, and on this case, it works quite well!  There's only two resources here: First, people. How do you get people? Capture a town. You DON'T build the towns, they already exist out there. Find one, force them to work with you by building some pointless-looking tower, and send your Captain on it. If the town has, for example, 300 recluits, you will be able to build 300 soldiers. Most troops go in sets of 12, 16 or 30, though. And what's the other resource? Honor. You get honor by killing enemy units, doesn't matter if they're scouts, simple soldiers, or their captains. With honor, you can build stronger units, like cavalry.  There are 3 races: Romans (Hey cousin, let's go bolling!), Barbarians, and Egypcians. It's not too much, I know, but just like the 4 races of Warcraft 3, they all feel different: Romans mainly use their formations, and rely on the player to think before doing anything stupid, using the terrain to it's favor. Barbarians have less troops, but can work together, setting up powerful traps (for example, their main warriors can immobilize an enemy troop long enough for you to aim your siege units, and annihilate them), and the Egypcians...Well, they're not used much, mainly because their troops are weaker, but faster to build. It turns into a Zerg-rush quite quick. That doesn't mean they're not good to play as, just not as fun. Their Special units (remember, you build them with honor) are quite powerful, though.  When it comes to how to navigate the map, and how gameplay works into it, it feels like Warcraft III, but more tactical:   Troops that are not spear-mans and cavalry can go into forests. Inside them, they're invisible for the enemies outside.   The tall-grass works in a similar way, but spear-mans are allowed to go in. The bad part of it, is that archers can set the tall-grass on fire, making it hard to go across, and pretty much instantly killing any soldiers hidden on it.   Only your main soldiers (like the Roman legionnaires), and I think Siege units as well, won't be able to cross rivers.   Troops that are in high-grounds will get vision of anything bellow, and will get extra-range of they're ranged units. Units bellow won't see from where the attacks are comming, and won't see the enemies as well.  You get the idea. It doesn't matter that you build yourself a huge army with 500 soldiers, you go in without exploring first, and you're probably getting your ♥♥♥ whopped. Because that's another thing, exploration units! There are two, ground and sky exploration:  With the ground scout, you can check forests and tall-grass. And incase you think the enemy might be near, you can send your wolf instead. Don't worry, the wolf won't get killed, but they can chase it and find the scout!  The sky scout works like the ground one while you don't use his companion, an eagle. You can send it to any nearby places, and see from the sky what's up there. It scouts way quicker than the ground one, but won't get any vision on woods, and any enemy range unit will scare it off with an attack.  You get the main idea, this game is Warcraft III, set in the Ancient Rome, and serious as hell. If you're a filthy casual, you can indeed have fun with the single player and the bots, though. The story mode is actually quite long, with like 30 or more chapters, all of them with voices and it's own story, all of it, based on real battles. The bots play well, and come in 3 different settings of difficulty, and the maps are quite good as well. And incase you get bored of the game, or want more stuff, there's one mod called 'Imperial Mod 5.0', or something like that, that adds a bunch more races, a ♥♥♥♥-load of maps, more music, and better textures. Of course, the game looks dated at these times...But I don't mind, it was pretty before, and it's kind of pretty today, still.  If you love real-time strategy games, and don't like to set up bases to farm like a prick for half the match, you should look into this game. Specially with the price drops. Right now, as I write this, it's at less than 1€, and I can tell you, for that price YOU SHOULD TOTALLY BUY IT. At full price it's something like 4-5€, and even though it's still a good price, you might want to wait for a better deal. Just let yourself go, and enjoy old games that where actually good, without ripping off all your money.",1,1

3389059,277680,"About Love, Hate and the other ones","Someone gifted me this game so I felt obligated to play and rate. Since I dont have and play many games my opinion may be weak. I heard 80 levels in this game so im at about 50 or 60 ish and I'm just gonna have to stop.  Pros puzzles music simple undo button When you cut the air out from under love/hate they make funny faces  cons too simple puzzles become tedious and not difficult. mistakes made at beginning make undo worthless at times  I actually tried to get the stars or whatever from finding the simplest/fastest solution for about 20 levels before I began to really hate myself. I guess this isn't a bad game I just wasn't challenged by it. For this reason I can't recommend. It is only 7 bucks and everyone has a discount thingy. I even got it for free and I'm still complaining. Maybe its cause I just came from playing a lot of hexcells which made my brain hurt in a good way.   I think the real issue is that I was solving the puzzles faster than the game allowed me to click due to the platforming nature. When the switch flips in my mind that 'oh hey I figured it out' there is a lot of buzzing and excitement. Having to click Love guy, click other ones, wait for little slow heart to travel, wait for other ones to move, click hate guy, move hate guy, etc... It just formed this disconnect that you dont want from gaming if you desire it to be immersive. But before I get all existential about gaming, I should finish my review.

Diehard Dungeon is one of those quick consumables that doesn't leave you wishing you just had your main course instead. A fantastic, admittedly short, roguelite with all the elements you need for repeat playthroughs.  What I believe to be one of the greatest things about Diehard Dungeon is that it's really not inteded for your more 'extreme' Roguelike audiance, and is heavily pushing to the Roguelite gameplay.. while, at the same time, still appealing to that 'harsher audience' due to the game's initial appeared difficulty.",1,0

3393925,278360,A Story About My Uncle," This is a long review, so if you want a brief summary of why I recommend  A Story About My Uncle  skip to  Results  and read from there.   Gone North Games creates a thrilling first person platformer that offers a fantastic story with challenging gameplay. A Story About My Uncle is a fine example of a casual, yet challenging platformer experience filled with beautiful environments.    Story:  A Story About My Uncle involves the story of a boy, most likely a teenager, who is alone in his uncles cabin surrounded by tundra. The game starts as the boy recalls a story about his uncle and the interesting life he led. As you play through the experience you slowly end up living a wonderful adventure of your own while learning about the amazing world your uncle has created. As you explore through caverns and floating islands you meet interesting characters who help piece together the gaps within your uncle’s life while forming your own story.   Campaign:  Overall the campaign is a decent length, you’ll probably get anywhere from four (4) to eight (8) hours of gameplay out of this. If you want to find every secret you probably could spent a significant amount of additional time playing the game. The campaign offers a variety of different environments, but ultimately it is relatively repetitive. You’ll go through caves, some floating islands, then caves with floating islands. The achievements act as challenges for this game rather than progression points, so despite the game essentially just being the campaign you could go back and play the levels as challenges to get the achievements, but realistically this has no impact on the actual game itself.  The campaign is relatively easy, which perfectly suits the design and style of this game. You may die a couple times as you go through, but the smooth checkpoint placement and relatively simple puzzles make this game fun rather than annoying.    Gameplay:  As platformer FPS style games go this one is pretty good with the controls and hit boxes. You’ll find yourself rarely thinking that you should have landed somewhere you didn’t or hit something you would have missed. As the game is an FPS you don’t have to deal with poor camera elements as you could see in an third person platformer, but with this same light you’ll also find you may need to have your sensitivity up high if you need to make a quick turn-around.  The game plays off you having a power suit that adds functions throughout the game, but honestly you’ll find that you essentially only unlock three abilities and they are all pretty basic. You’ll get the ability to jump higher, the ability to propel forward, and a grappling hook. You’ll essentially be using the same abilities throughout the game to solve relatively similar puzzles.    Results:  I’d recommend A Story About My Uncle for anyone looking for a relatively casual, yet immersive experience. The gameplay is somewhat similar to mirrors edge in that you will be running and jumping, but focuses more on utilizing your power suits special abilities to propel yourself through puzzles and into unique places. I personally grabbed this game when it was 75% off, and would recommend doing the same; but, if you absolutely love platformer fps then this is the game for you and you might as well pay full price.   Pros: +Decent graphics and visuals +Relaxing soundtrack +Good story +Platformer FPS with some puzzle elements +Good check point distance (making dying less annoying) +Decent length  Cons: -Relatively repetitive gameplay style -Repeating environments",1,1
3394174,278360,A Story About My Uncle,"I highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of puzzle, first-person platformers such as mirror's edge. although short, This game has an amazing atmosphere to it filled with beautiful landscapes and very like-able characters, with some very sad scenes that just make you want to replay to re-live those moments. again, I highly recommend.",1,0
3394729,278360,A Story About My Uncle,"TLDR: Worth a play. Wait for a sale.  This is a pretty game and interesting. I'm not done with it yet, but I've played enough to get the hang of it and give a fair review before I finish, I think. The game mechanic (just one, really.) is fun and clever, but a bit clumsy. You run/jump/grapple to swing and shoot through platform levels. The problem is that the game can be a bit picky about what you grapple and what you don't.   Theoretically, you can grapple anywhere, but the game seems to prioritize the technically 'correct' way through by letting you grab from further away. I can be well within range of a windmill arm and attempt a grapple and nothing happens, but be twice as far out and shoot for the one (out of four) windmill arms that has the mark on it, signifying I'm supposed to grab that one, and it will connect no problem. Other times, the grapple will refuse to connect if I have been clever and shot past where the game expects me to grapple first, seeming to only connect if I've already hit the previous contact point first. A bit annoying and makes for more deaths than necessary and can be a bit immersion-breaking.  It's also not always clear what you're supposed to do and where you're supposed to go. I'm not saying it needs a map or arrows or breadcrumbs or HUD, but some tweaking would help to make sure I'm going the right general direction in a level, particularly after a death. Sometimes I respawn facing a totally different direction. Maybe that means I was going the wrong way. Maybe the game just spawned me the wrong way. Who knows. I suck.   Still, it's worth a play and if you can get it under 5 bucks, I'd say go for it.",1,0
3395491,278360,A Story About My Uncle,Pros-  -The feeling of speed and acceleration in this game is fantastic. -In terms of story it might be simple but its cute. -Visually stunning -Fun  Cons -Huge difficulty spike in last level (far from impossible but still seems a bit out of place) -Fairly short (sub 3 hours)  Overall I think this game is a nice pickup and i would highly reccomend it.,1,0

On every server, wherever it is located (although most servers are located in Russia), there are always tons of d!cks around the map.  Now for the actual review. When I first played this game, I was like 'WUT' for the first 37 minutes. 1. You have to pay:  a) for blocks  b) for block shapes  c) for how long this item is to stay in your inventory (seriously?) 2. You can't mine, you can only build (d!cks) and destroy. 3. The only option for map size available is 'Small'. A funkin' countryhouse is bigger than this map. 4. 6-year old players (yes, really). 5. If you try to use your microphone, it will tell you to allow access in the next window. Dang it, that's a port of a browser game. In Steam. Robin, I'm disappoint. 6. Character models look funked. 7. Actually, everything looks funked. 8. Don't try to play this 'game' after watching its trailer. Really, just don't. 9. Oh, good old 'УХАДИ' jokes. Shouted outloud by 9 year olds. 10. Also, about 9 year olds: they mostly use foul language. Just tell one of these that you heard their Mom return in the background of their voice, and they'll shut up for a moment. It works. 11. You can't place blocks underneath yourself. 12. Don't attempt to build a house - it WILL be destroyed no matter how nice it looks. 13. Trying to ban a person that has destroyed your house if you host a server turns into a pretty bad idea on a server with many people. Just because you can't see nicknames. 14. Don't try to kill a player. Nothing will happen. 15. Mine dirt with a pickaxe. Just because it's great.  So these are my impressions on this game so far.

3408390,280160,Aragami,"  This game is phenominal.  There are not many games I recommend let alone write a review for but this is one of them. I remember playing the demo/proof of concept for this game a  very  long time ago and I can tell you that this game has come a long way since then.  This is a very good stealth game. Reminiscent of games like Dishonored, Dark Souls, and more but provides an experience well enough to stand on it's own two feet. It is brutal and fun. The animations are beautifully detailed, the art style is fantastic and the gameplay is hard and rewarding. If you are found by the many guards of the game you will likely die and die quickly. Death is a big part of the game given you will probably do so a lot and learn each time you die.  You enter the game as the 'Aragami' or a vengful spirit made of shadows, brought to life by a ghostly woman named Yamiko. You are given a sword and brought through a quick tutorial and then unleashed the the somewhat-open world levels that the game has to offer, things such as teleportation, traps, throwing kunai and more are learned at your own pace. Each area generally has two or more entrances and two or less exits but the world doesn't feel confining. Given you are made of shadow you can only teleport from shadow to shadow, practically invisible while crouching in one. You only regenerate your powers when you are in shadow and drain when in light but are unaffected by moonlighting.  The game has a simple yet well written story and while I find the end to be predictable I was still impressed and after my time playing I found myself sitting back and reflecting on the entire thing and just telling myself that it was such a good game.  I finished the game in just under 15 hours and that's playing through each mission in the 13 mission campaign twice for an all-kill and all-stealth run, collecting all the collectables to be found to be the strongest I could be by the final boss. Unfortunately in a game as stealth-oriented as this boss fights don't really incorporate all the powers you can utilize but nevertheless it is still entertaining and enjoyable, not to mention threatening to have bosses have a general idea of where you are due to their immense power in light energy to combat your shadow energy.  Although I did get the game as a gift I would definitely recommend paying full price for this truly great experience; I greatly look forward to potential DLC further down the line. If I had to give this a numbered score I would give it a 9 out of 10.",1,0
3408640,280160,Aragami,"So incredibly many bugs it's sickening.  It feels like more of a chore to beat the game than having any fun to it. I can't tell you how disappointing this is. I was really looking forward to this... I'm sorry if this sounds rude, but considering how many bugs I found and how hard it was to beat 3 missions due to the bugs, it's really annoying.  I got stuck in a bird cage by walking toward it trying to let the raven out. Had to restart the entire mission.  I try killing the guards sometimes and it literally just doesn't do anything but it'' shake the screen like I'm trying to stab them but I'm having a nervous breakdown. Had to restart the entire mission.  I cleared an entire area of about 10-15 guards and a guard basically fell out of the map so I couldn't kill him, he was the last one on that map. Had to restart entire mission.  Touching water instantly kills you and makes you restart from the last damn check point and some of them take forever.

3411723,280600,BloodLust Shadowhunter,"No sir, I didn't like it.  The controls are goofy, the gameplay is meh at best, and it looks and feels like a game from about fifteen years ago. Not horrible, but not something I'd want to play these days. The music is just an endless loop of the same woman going 'eeeeeeEEEEEEEeeeeeeeee~' in a spooky voice while someone keeps whispering 'come closer, I won't hurt you'.  All in all, the game did not grab me whatsoever which is a damn shame because I love games set in the World of Darkness universe like Vampire Bloodlines (which I got the impresison this game was a tribute to).  Worst part? The support page for the game doesn't appear to be working correctly so I can't get a refund.  Buyer very much beware.

This game has economic, diplomatic, combat, black market, exploration, empire building, strategy, and so many more aspects its amazing. This game is like a living galaxy within your computer.

3412875,281220,BloodRayne: Betrayal (Legacy),"A few elements that this game have that i am a sucker for :  1.)A Female Protagonist fighting game. 2.)2/2.5D platformer hack and slash game. 3.)Decent+ graphics  The game got all that stated above, However, it doesn't seems like they are the main goal of this game. Trickjumping is, And i do not mean platforming, But trickjumping (A combination of a few jumping 'mechanics' at the proper time to execute a successful jump), e.g. : Slide and jump, Goomba jump, Blown to the air/take damage jump, and so on. And this is not the reason why i bought this game, And is more than enough to ruin it to the threshold of whining in a bad review.  Another downside is the color saturation, But that's more on a personal note, it actually made my eyes hurt.  One last downside, because why not, Sometimes you get 5 checkpoints in a row (yay). and some levels you are lucky to get one....  The combat is fun for a while but who cares since its not the main goal of the game, Once again it seems like a development studio forgot what game they were trying to develop.

This issue only pops up when battles start getting larger. So if you buy this game and start playing the campaign, you won’t run into this until it is too late to return it.  Alot of people are having this problem and the 'fixes' are not working.  I recommend waiting to see if these issues are resolved.  OR  Buying it, firing up a big skirmish right away to see if you are affected by the unplayable FPS issues plaguing some people.

3415485,281610,Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak,"I would not reccomend this to most gamers, especially anyone looking for any depth. This is a very retro game in spirit with some prettiness which is why I can say it is Recommended with reservations, the main criticism being the campaign is very short and too easy especially near end game. 13 missions is too few. The units are a bit too realistic to the point of being bland on the eyes. Characters are named things like 'Intel Officer' -who is the narrator- are entirely devoid of personality.  The story is historically inspired in ways that the tactics your fleet are taking IS the main storyline and all you are doing are the shooty parts. I do believe you have seen all these units in other games as well ( like Battlecruisers with their underwhelming size and coolness).  The main payoff is solid Command and Conquer-esque gameplay; minus all infantry. Unfortunately the tactic of tanking with RachelsT'ank (sic) and the carrier are way too effective for nearly the whole game. There is no base building. There are no real decisions to make other than what to unlock when. Just balling is clearly a tactic that will win the game on medium in 11 hrs easy. It's clear from the beggining that if you stall to get more resources you will be rewarded.   I would also have welcomed a replay feature as some of the battles would be impressive to watch from unit perspective (double clicking to follow a unit) as it's way too hectic to appreciate the pretty FX with all the battling to be done.  Sadly the campaign is completely linear and the tech tree (if you could call it that) is incredibly shallow. For $25 though: yeah. IF you loved both Homeworld and Command and Conquer a LOT like I did. I wish they could have spent just a few more $$$ and made at least twice as many levels, that would have made this a great game instead of just a good one.",-1,0
3415952,281640,The Banner Saga 2,"Wow, Ok I have just finished The Banner Saga 2 and wow what a journey! Do you need to have played the first one? Yes I do believe so, you will seriously miss out on lore and back story for the characters if you don’t! Not to mention your choices from the first game are carried over.   This game has made some great improvements most notably for myself is the foraging system. In the first game you had to buy supplies with renown which was also required to level up, you had to balance on the fine line of ‘keeping your people alive?’ or ‘levelling up to win battles’ Now while you do still need to buy supplies your clansmen now go out and forage while on the path which is a massive help. There are also new a new species, new enemies and hazards in the battlefields now which makes the battles more interesting.   The story continues on from the last game and more is revealed and hinted at as to why the world is breaking. But the game is left on a massive cliff-hanger so gosh darn it I can’t wait for the third game! Please don’t let it be in two years…  The music is again beautiful and atmospheric, I made sure to purchase the special edition so I own the OST. The art is again just magnificent and makes me desperately want an official art book. HINT HINT stoic!  This game is worth the asking price, I have no regrets. Though it did feel a little shorter than the first one, however I’m not entirely sure if it is because this one is shorter or rather the final boss in the previous one took many many many retries….  Once again the developers have released a brilliant game and have made me a devoted fan for life!  Thanks for a great experience, can’t wait for the next one! ",1,0
3416720,281940,Woolfe - The Red Hood Diaries,"Woolfe attracted me as soon as I saw its store page, even though I am not the biggest fan of platformer games. A story rich game that tells a steampunk version of the Red Riding Hood classical tale, a female protagonist, very nice visuals - all of these contributed to my excitement. However, after I started to play it, my enthusiasm decreased a lot because the overall polish of the game falls short of expectations.   The story starts by introducing the player to Red's mission: she is supposed to infiltrate the city of Ulrica in order to stop the evil machinations of “B. B. Wolfe” and find her father's assassin. In order to do that, she jumps up on ledges or double jumps to reach far off platforms and fights occasional enemies.  The game is designed on a 3D plane, and Red has full range of movement but she is largely locked to a 2D perspective. Some of these 3D segments are rather disorientating, since the camera is mostly locked from the front and you can't tell very well which item is closer to the viewer and which is further away, this resulting often in failed jumps, until you learn the exact starting spot of the jump. But even a bigger problem is the controls in this 2.5D plane. Since the controller that I use currently has an issue, I had to switch to keyboard. And moving with a keyboard in a 3D plane, trying to simulate an analog stick using only the arrow keys, is very difficult. This added a lot to the frustration I felt playing this game. I died multiple times during the combat scenes because I wasn't able to move easily in a circle around the boss. This is one of the games that require a controller for a smooth gameplay experience, which a keyboard can't really provide.  The combat in the game is not satisfying. There are several enemy types in the game (rats, mechanical soldiers, fairies and wolves), but none gives a feedback when hit. There are no health bars on the enemies (unless the enemy is a boss), so you can't tell which one to prioritize from a group. Red has a light and a heavy attack to use, and later in the game she learns a couple of other special moves; these aren't always effective since they're in slow motion, and during those seconds Red is easily stunned making it impossible to attack and consuming her whole attack energy at the same time; hence it's much more effective to mash the buttons for the 2 basic attacks until all the enemies die. Red's weapon accuracy is far from dependable since the enemy hitboxes bug out quite often and there’s no indication of a missed hit whatsoever.    http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=443555057   One of the boss fights was really bugged for me, while performing it in hard mode. I spent around 5 hours trying to figure out what I was doing wrong because right before the last phase the boss’ health stopped going down, even though I was continuously hitting him. Restarting the game the next day fixed the problem - apparently one of the boss’ phases was somehow misplaced and replaced by the easy mode version despite me setting the fight on hard mode from the beginning.  Jumping from one place to the next is also a source of frustration in Woolfe, and I've wasted a lot of time trying to progress to the next step because the controls just failed on me. At times, pressing space for double jump midair didn’t seem to have any reaction from the game so I often had to restart from the last checkpoint and do the whole thing again, including killing all the enemies, only to reach the same spot and fail the jump again.  On a positive side, the game's greatest feature lies in its straightforward, but nonetheless compelling, narrative. The story is narrated by Red through rhymes, and her funny sarcasm accompanies you while platforming through the streets of Ulrica or through the forest outside the city. The music is rather well composed and does add to the atmosphere of Woolfe’s world.  The graphics are lovely and the lighting effects in the town and forest are impressive. The graphics enhance the story a lot by imbuing everything with a natural magic. However, I can’t help but feel that too much of the budget and time was spent on the visuals alone, leaving the overall experience feeling a bit rushed, but still enjoyable to some extent.   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=442399266   Overall I decided to give this game a positive rating since despite the lack of polish in combat and the soggy platforming experience, it manages to maintain a satisfactory level of enjoyment through its unique world, beautifully and artistically designed, as long as you use a controller to play it and don’t go for 100% achievements. Woolfe needed a bit more work before being released and it could have been a great game if the combat bugs were fixed. Nevertheless, it's an impressive effort from the part of a 5 people team.

Over 500 hours on Crusader Kings. Over a month worth of hours on the Total War Franchise. I've played and loved strategy since getting my hands on Age of Empires as a kid. I even play Dota. Therefore it pains me to write this negative review for a game that I really wanted to love.

Any game just sort of drifts into boringness at some point and you start over. The only enjoyable part is and was the early to early-mid game, which on it's own is honestly not worth the money. It feels almost insulting that there are already 2 DLCs for additional money out there after delievering such a desaster on realease that still cannot be called a complete game. The only thing holding it together is modding community. Maybe wait another half year and look for some bundled sale - the potential is out there.. somewhere  tl;dr: Whoever thought that it was a good idea to release paid DLC for a game that isn't finished needs a slap.

3417387,281990,Stellaris,"Great start. Poor follow up. The game barely runs after a couple hundred years on larger maps. The diplomacy options are basic, and the AI is awful. I truly enjoyed the concept and the interesting universe, as well as the occasional missions to keep you busy during those natural 4k lulls. However, the midgame boredom, and flaccid AI has completely pushed me away form this title. I may pick it up again in 6 months as there are a number of patches planned.

3417503,281990,Stellaris,"  The game has one big problem from my subjective viewpoint - warscore, instead of going out and conquering/wiping planets as you might be used to from another 4x games, it lets you define wargoals, where you can specify which planets you want to gain. There are 2 main isssues with this - you can only define small amount of planets as wargoal, seems 1/5 of your opponent´s per war. 2nd issue - there is 10 years forced truce after war. What does it mean? Instead of having control over the war and how it develops you are trapped in this artifficial system which is just prolonging the gameplay in cumbersome way where you have to wage several wars with long breaks in between. This lacks the fluidity and good pace of anotehr 4x titles. Not sure if I would bought the game knowing about the war-truce limited system. This problem might change with future update, but is currently creating blank spots in the gameplay.",-1,1

You can create your own empire, customize ships, and choose leaders for your armies or governors for your planets.  Its a fun game for 39 bucks, no need to pay more unless DLCs are worth buying.  The only 2 negatives that stand out are: You don't have options to tweak graphic settings, just a general Low/medium/high for everything. Its easy for my PC but im always a fan of open options.  Another is later in the games, if your in large map the ships will freeze including the time clock as some sort of loading. I'm assuming thats because of all the info from all the other empires. So i had to start a new game with a smaller map.  Overall good game especially new for 39 bucks.",1,1
3421445,281990,Stellaris,"I would find the game fun, and in fact it is in every sense but the core mechanic that steals away what would culminate into an epic strategy game is the burdensome war and combat mechanic. And before you think, 'well the game isnt designed for farware.' yes, i've read into the thought process behind it, but it doesnt make it fun. It is frustrating when your fleet engages a space installation while a superior hostile fleet is imminently bearing down on it. To declare you must 'define objectives' and settle with what little paltry war spoils you may earn for yourself. Fleet controls are garbage when in comes towards organization, and way points are typically problematic because you dont know where a new spawned ship will fly off to for a single waypoint.  Second is the cosmetic unbecomingness of the species selection, and the pseudo-'build your own race' pitch. It boils down to what shape you want your ships, what gif image you want your species to be, and what name sceme they'll use. It was a great concept yet a weak application in my opinion. The borders of space i imagine would be contained in flight lanes and solar systems, not enormous and restrictive border boundaries. To build a space empire, you're quickly restricted by how far you can go, and worse yet, the 'sector' implementation. I've had to take a seat back and watch planets be mismanaged by a poorly programmed AI.  As for what was done right, the world set up and tech-trees are great. I love the tech development process, and the cost margins of the upgrades, its a great application.  In the end though, i sunk hours upon hours into a game with a complex face and great start, but a poorly optimiazed and slow system that, unless you enjoy micro-managing at a tedious level, ultimately culminates as a hairball of chore management, you'll find yourself with few epic moments, and a tediously slow world expasion.",-1,0

3422775,281990,Stellaris,"There's something here that makes me put a couple hours in every so often. It's the planet micro and lore writing that keeps the me entertained.  There are BIG CHUNKS missing so far in the game, not to mention bugs and imbalances. Energy is always in deficit. Sector AI is always ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ yet mandatory. Combat visuals are bland as ever. Combat mechanics is just who has the biggest corvette stack.  Need to click 3-5 times and zoom in zoom out to find out where my construction ship no.7 is at and where i need it to be. Ship designer is an illusion of choice, where you slap on whatever tech you happen to have. Techs take an ETERNITY to research.  Overall, there is a lack of events that raise an eyebrow rather than pop ups saying HEY READ THIS and aforementioned planet gets a meagre +3 to physics research. As said, the writing is top notch and not too bad to read, but becomes a disgusting eyesore like porn after you're finished. As of the recent leviathan dlc (10 bucks), there are now butterfly bosses littered around so there's sth for your fleet to chew on. The plantoid pack (another 10 bucks) gives you new portraits and ship art.  Some say the game will be fleshed out by DLCs, updates, and mods.

3436938,282070,This War of Mine,"I like the Idea of showing how war is like to civilians in real life, while we are usually running around and killing thousands of bad guys, not wasting one thought on civilians - apart from when rescuing them is an objective. I like the graphic style of WoM, which fits the setting quite well. And how every decesion affects people around you in some way makes you think every time what is the right or the wrong thing to do (which isn`t really a question as you will see further below). But (and that is a big one): In the end that all does not work out. For a game like this, which wants to catch the cold and threatening atmosphere of a shelled city, atmosphere is crucial and so is the music. It should be tense and kind of pulling you down. But instead is it more like someone is playing nice quiet tunes at a campfire. So for me the atmosphere just does not fit the setting, which is a big con to me. In addition, the game mechanics are repetitive and too simple. Watching a character ditching for the 20th time for a minute is just not exiting. Another thing I disliked, was the attitude of the characters you play. No matter what you do, the other chracters are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off because of your actions. For example even though they were starving and you brought food by stealing it, they will be mad at you anyway. They all seem to be noble selfless knights, with no will to survive what so ever. Of course some people are like that, but war is about survival and sometimes you have to do things that are not nice to survive. It would have made the game experience way better if the gameplay represented that. It would also have been interesting if chracters in your group had different opinions on that, so conflicts between them may arise. But they are always personalisations of higher morals. That is unrealistic on the one hand and boring on the other, because there is always a clear right and a wrong, which limits the possibilities of playing.   2.6 hrs on record.

3437226,282070,This War of Mine,"Despite this review being a negative review, the first thing I want to say is that this game is a good game and you should play this game. In fact, I highly encourage you to. What this review is negative about are the controls, game mechanics and the general fact that the game plays like a lazy port from a tablet game to a PC game.  It seems to me from the outset that 11bit studios intended to release this game on mobile/tablet devices, but they ended up with something too good so they decided to go for a PC release, without updating or changing control schemes. Their experience with the excellent reverse-tower defense game Anomaly for Android devices supports this idea.  The controls of the game involve you clicking around the screen to direct the characters to do certain tasks such as scavenge, cook, trade, move and actually pretty much everything. The control scheme is such that it would work very nicely if played on a tablet device. Your mouse doesn't even have it's own unique cursor in-game, which does detract from the experience.  However, as intuitive as the controls are, the scheme really lets itself down when it comes to combat and stealth. Character pathfinding in this game can often result in you running right next to enemies or your character freezing up so they don't move and end up being killed. I know the game stresses that 'you are not an elite soldier', but these sort of deaths due to the control scheme feel cheap and unfair.  OVerall, I want to stress that this IS a good game. Perhaps it's one of the most effective games in portraying warfare realistically out there. BUt keep in mind that it still is just a glorified tablet game.",-1,0
3437438,282100,Fearless Fantasy,"Rating: 2/10  This is not the kind of turn-based RPG you'd expect. It has got the soul of a mobile game whereby you swipe, tap and do other gestures for successful attack/defense moves. And this is a really bad idea when your finger is replaced by a mouse, which makes the game feel clunky and awkward. The art style of the game sure is bizzare, but not in a good way. Sure I appreciate the surreal feel of the game, but the artist didn't do the best job with the main characters - They look like an anime-crazy 10 year old drew them. The voice acting is cheesy at best, and the script matches it perfectly - Again not in a good way. I would only recommend playing this on a mobile device. Avoid playing this on PC unless you are okay with the controls and all the things I complained of.",-1,1
3439448,282140,SOMA,"I carried a buddha statue halfway across the ocean floor, only to have to incinerate it for science.    The game was short. This was partly due to its simple nature -- there were no in-game mechanics such as inventory or character management. You essentially walk around, open doors and avoid monsters.  The visuals were great. The game ran pretty smoothly.  The audio was fantastic, especially the foley.  Scary at some points, but doesn't feel desperate or urgent, or even very deadly. This was not nearly as scary or desperate as a lot of Amnesia: The Dark Descent. I am reluctant to compare other horror games to it, however, because when I played Amnesia I was definitely more naive and knew much less about games than I do now. Games in general seem to get less scary as I get older.  Story seems overexplained by the main character, he wasn't very likable and the script seemed to shove all the interesting parts in your face. It seems as though the developers were worried that people wouldn't understand what was going on, so they spelled everything out.  The stealth is very basic. The enemies had variety but were never difficult to get past or particularly frightening.  No replay value, expectedly.  SPOILERS: At the end,    some plot points seem rushed. While the choices you make throughout the game don't have consequences, they still provide some moral satisfaction (killing life-supported people, the robot guy in the beginning, destroying the WAU)       Overall, a decent experience. Interesting things are tackled in the story. Mildy scary. Immersive.    ",1,0

I am on the Curie, and apparently there's supposed to be a wheel somewhere to activcate a ladder, but I can't bloody look around to find it because there's this idiotic creature that you can't look at or he kills you wandering around, and he won't give you 10 seconds without walking right up to you and killing you whether you look at him or not. It doesn't matter if you are sneaking or not. If you stay on one place. he walks right to you. If you move around, you can't do anything but stare at the damn floor or he kills you. What good are visuals if you have to stare at the floor??? Seriously, how the hell are you supposed to look around and find anything when you can't look around???

Although they DID remove these from the accounts, they did it because the accounts DONT EXIST ANYMORE. Now it is linked to your steam account. The other major complaint is that, it obviously costs $10 now. A pretty steep price for a rehash of a very old game. But hear me out, People have been told to switch to steam over and over again. This is because the people who have even LAUNCHED or DOWNLOADED THE GAME WITHOUT PLAYING back when it was F2P recieve the ENTIRE GAME FOR FREE. People, do the god damn research before accusing. You can add friends through steam and in-game, the stats are linked to your steam account.   If you are considering buying this game, you might want to hold off or maybe just look at other games in it's price range, as Quake has a large learning curve and is very difficult to get good at. Although i personally believe it would be worth $10, it is a steep price for a game from 1999 with a slightly updated engine.   So all-in-all, if you owned the game before, hit Play Now.

I wont review the gameplay of the game play because there are a lot more thoughtful reviews already posted. However there are some crash issues of this game as it was originally designed for console. Its different for everyone, but for me it was crash during save.  For me it crashed really often during save especially if im over writing save and saving inside mech factor dungeons. It took so long to find fix to this solution mostly due to not knowing what is causing it. Basically I started saving on empty slots only and crash reduced by almost 99%... still happened like once or two after this.  So once your save slots are almost filled... I manually deleted the physical files to create more empty save slots. Documents\My Games\Idea Factory International, Inc\Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1  Hopefully this helped if you experience same crash issues as me.  I also recommend using controller for this game. Its a lot more better with it IMO cuz you can sit back and relax while playing. I used Ps4 controller with xpadder to customise settings.

3464167,283230,Spoiler Alert,"Before you say anything about the time, I finished the entire game and the bonus world... moving on...  TL;DR: The actual platforming elements are wonky and generally just a mess (as is kinda standard for comedy games), the comedy is nonexistant, and the concept fails completely. Do not recommend.  This game's concept is really interesting. You can read that above.  This game's execution of its concept is really bad.  For the conept to work, the game has to make sense both in forward and reverse. If either direction doesn't make sense, the game is very flawed.  Heads up: spoiler alert. I'm suggesting you not play it, so I don't see much reason for me to try to avoid spoiling it (and the game is asking for it).  Logically, the place to start in checking if a game makes sense is in the forward direction, I'd think.  Okay, first level, intricate spike placement combined with floor tiles that change the speed at which you move combined with projectile shooting enemies. K. That's... K.  Err... first world's boss. Hit button, turns on laser that reflects enemy attacks then... turn it off when you're done and turn on a different one? Oooookay. It drops coins and then (at least whoever played it before the player gets there) avoid all the coins that it randomly poops out because reasons. K.  ......  Last level! One goomba. Six coins. Boss that dies in one hit. K.  Okay. Forward doesn't make sense. Therefore, the execution of the concept is horribly flawed.   The game is calling itself a comedy platformer, so I can excuse that the actual platforming is kinda crappy (I mean, DLC Quest isn't fun because of the actual things you do in it), but it HAD to get the concept right, which it didn't.  Even outside of the entire level design failing, there are specific things that break the idea. The projectile-shooting things from the first level? They look injured when their projectiles get back to them. Shouldn't there be a smug 'I'm going to shoot you!' look? There's disappear-for-a-moment-after-you-touch-them blocks, which would have been a really cool concept for a game like this. They're disappear-then-reappear-right-before-you-touch-them blocks... but they don't work like that in this game. They just disappear for a moment after you touch them.  The only actual joke it makes is at the end/beginning where it tries to handwave why it is that the game doesn't make sense forward... but... it doesn't work. By the time you get there, you're already so tired of the game not making any sense, that any explanation at that point is too little too late.  I also did the mariachi bonus world. It's not fun either and it has the same problems.   So... the actual platforming elements are wonky and generally just a mess (as is kinda standard for comedy games), the comedy is nonexistant, and the concept fails completely.

However it has a few hiccups in which I would only recommend someone to buy this game if on sale so they don't feel cheated. The combat with the wizards can be particularly frustrating since they don't always register how close an enemy is and shoot magic rather than meleeing a target. The boss-ish kind of battles would feel more epic if it was a little more challenging, since upon completion you are left feeling not too satisfied. The biggest gripe I have with the game is how it feels incomplete since it only inculdes the story of the 1st and 2nd movie.

3492732,285980,Kromaia,"Kromaia is a very immersive 360° shmup. It takes some time to understand, what exactly is going on on screen, as your flying through space, barrel rolling and pew-pewing everything in your way, but once you take your time, slow down and pay attention - everything becomes clear and you will have a blast. As far as I can tell, there is a story mode and a score attack mode, where you can pick any of the 4 ships available. The ships are very different and offer different playstyle - from melee hits to homing missiles and precise laser pew-pew. The fitting music, the tight controls and the 360° freedom is what makes the game so immersive. In story mode there are 4 difficulty settings and according to the developers - adaptive AI, that adjusts to your abilities, ensuring you’ll always face a true challenge. I played on medium, had my fair share of deaths and cannot confirm nor deny the adaptive part. I would love to be able to play in fullscreen mode, but there isn't one (?!) or I can't find it. Also I would like to see some vsync option or a way to limit the fps, as the game is running rampant with over 120. Overall, I'm enjoying my time with the game, but I do find the price tag way to steep, so I can wholeheartedly recommend Kromaia, once it goes on sale.

3493114,286040,Dead Effect,"Very bland gameplay with slow sluggish controls and a bland linear storyline.   This game is outdated and very rough feeling, resembling an early Quake game. DE honestly felt like I was playing a cheap knockoff of Doom but with zombies instead of demons. The voice acting is just poor and no background or story is giving unless you really look for the hidden data pads found within levels, but even those don't paint you a very good picture,  The zombies are easy enough to kill but one in particular, a grenade throwing soldier will instantly kill you if his incredibly precise throw hits anywhere even near you. But wait, if you die you can use credits found across the ship to revive!!  Oh, but that doesn't matter when you are stuck in certain corridor or above elevators where the moment to move out to proceed, BOOM! the zombie will suicide bomb you over and over until you restart the level.  Very weak gameplay, poor acting and story telling and a general feeling of unpolished gameplay, only get this if you can find it on sale for 1$.  Personal Rating: 1/5",-1,0

The game feels like a concept of a fecebok game - click on your mine to collect materials, it givs you 1 gold/second and holds max 35 gold. You can upgrade it to hold more gold. Sounds familiar?  The gameplay looked like fun, only to turn out to be imbalanced. You can approach a boss 20 times and fail, only to switch a lucky rock and unleash a barrage of bulets obeliterating everything in its ay.

3515493,2870,X Rebirth,"My no vote is potentially temporary. It's to be considered a No for right now. Absolutely do not buy this game right now. Just like the history of Egosoft games, it's been released riddled with bugs. Game killing bugs. Bugs that destroy the games ability to do the very things that this game needs to do in order to be a game.  But there have been seven patches so far. The lot of them together have fixed quite a bit, but not enough. I'm using patch 8 (beta) and the game is almost entirely playable at this point. It's sort of nice. But it's still not quite there yet. If you jump in, jump in after version 2.0 maybe.   I've played this game for over 20 hours. Am I a massochist? Yes. Wait.. no. I just really, really want a great modern space combat/trade/exploration sim. This isn't it... but it has the potential to be. That potential and seeing what I can do next... the empire that I will eventually be able to build is what has kept me going. That and the patches. By version 1.8, players should be able to trade mostly. It is nice.  If you are an old X player, this game doesn't work like the last three. You do build up an empire, but you do it from a single ship. You can't take command of cap ships or freighters. Is this a game breaker? For some people, yes. For me? Well, I don't prefer it this way, but the skunk is a capable and fun ship to fly, and I still can have a bunch of other ships at my disposal (and I can ride around in them outside my ship, so that's cool.)  The acting is terrible. TERRIBLE. But... it's an Egosoft game. Expecting good acting out of an Egosoft game is like expecting an EA game to not have microtransactions.  I give this game a tentative thumbs up for a first or second quarter 2014 purchase.   Unfortunately by then, we may have Star Citizen or the new Elite. Or maybe another unexpected title? It remains to be seen.  Maybe try it on a steam sale. Heck, there's at least one poor schlub out there enjoying it despite its flaws. (that would be me.)",-1,0

I thought it would be a long, jump scare filled horror with plenty of freedom to tackle horrifyingly difficult encounters in your own way.  As it turns out, BR2: Episode 1 is extremely short (see that play time? yeah, that short), only made me jump scare once (because I was about to sneeze), and is rather linear (though it was quite good at hiding the linearity), and the improvising was limited to -kill with bullets -kill with knife -kill with brick throw. Of course, the option to use bullets is there as long as you don\'t blanket fire, so the other options are pointless.  One thing that did surprise me, however, was the story. Much more interesting, character driven, creepy-thriller style story than I thought.  As a side note, I guess I am not in a position to complain about gore and language in a game like this.

3528364,287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,"I'm gonna start off by saying that Hideo Kojima is a god. that is all.   Metal gear solid as a series is large, very large with it's story. This game ties everything together leading to Metal gear 1 and 2 before Metal gear solid 1 on the playstation.  Unlike in previous installments,the open worlds in MGS5 lets you tackle the missions however the hell you want: you can sneak in without any alarms going off just like the way it should well damn be, or you can go guns blazing in and out but the problem is reinforcements will keep coming and eventually you'll get picked off if you're not lucky enough to get out alive.   You'll be in control of your very own commanding base out in the middle of the sea and as you recruit more personel with specific skills in each department, you'll watch mother base grow and grow bigger and better, and being able to develop better tools, weapons, and other gear to help you tackle your missions. You'll run into special characters who can act as support to help you out in the fields. This is also huge, you can set up another base to collect more resources but it can be invaded by other players so once you recieve the notification, you can drop what you're doing and stop that other snake....it'll get wierd.  The cinematics are off the charts, its like watching a movie or some ♥♥♥♥, and along with the outstanding visuals, the game seems to be optimized very well, even for the laptop i'm using right now, which is a Lenovo y700 with 8 gigs of ram, ddr4 i think, Nvidia 970m.  My number 1 complaint so far with the game is that there's regenerating health. sure, you take damage and all you need to do is hide behind something to recover quickly. I can't say I like this new addition opposed to having a life bar at the top unlike in previous installments in the series, so this really changes things up alot. therefore, Rations and other medical items unlike in the previous games will be absent because of health regen so in my opinion that kind of takes away from the entire point of not getting seen and taking damage when now you can just recover your health. but it's not all that bad though.  The other downside is the multiplayer mode as it just feels tacked on, 3rd person call of duty style gameplay with classes....in other words its a let down compared to metal gear online 1 and 2 (MGS3: Subsistence and MGS4: Guns of the Patriots, respectively.)  that's right, there's 3 classes to choose from and sometimes player controlled unique characters may join in the battle. Scout is a long ranged operator, enforceers are the bread and butter of infantry and then comes the infiltrators..and holy ♥♥♥♥, they are competely overpowerd because they have cloaking devices and both of the other classes are at a major disadvantage since they cannot see the cloaked pieces of ♥♥♥♥ and you wont know they're coming until they teleport to you, throw your ♥♥♥ on to the ground and end your pathetic life right on the spot with no ♥♥♥♥ing effort whatsoever. Whats worse is that Inflitrators can walk around with other weapons as well as shotguns..and there's no question how well they deal damage at close range, because you'll never see them pieces of ♥♥♥♥ coming straight for you unless there are beacons thrown around that reveal enemy positions.  This is huge here....in a bad way.  infiltrators totally ruin the whole ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ online mode aspect so bad, and to top it off, scouts also have access to automatic assault weapons that deal a great amout of damage, so it's a WTF situation for the enforcers. Everyone and their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed dog plays infiltrator. They should have made everyone the same playerbase or whatever like they did back in the previous online games prior to this call of duty 'I saw him first!' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, because that's what it ultimately comes down to at the end. Don't be suprised when the entire enemy team are all infiltrators armed with all kinds of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ power weapons and cloaking because of their high leveled characters. You stand absolutely no ♥♥♥♥ing chance in hell and it's like death coming straight at you while you can't even ♥♥♥♥ing see them at all! You don't even unlock a pair of infared goggles until like level thirty something, so what is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ point!? you might as well not even play this online mode. Oh and Infiltators can also get stealth camos that last the entire ♥♥♥♥ing time without any consequences and being able to fire at the same time while cloaked. wh  Face it, Multiplayer for this game is the true phantom pain.  There's loadouts, character customizations...the usual user friendly crap. It doesn't matter where you shoot them at, even in the foot counts as a head shot for some reason---It's all crap, damage rates are completely inconsistent. Took actual skill in the prior MGO games, like if you needed to down a player as quickly as possible, you just aim at the head. now you just spray and pray, and it works great while sitting in a corner holding that position...  t just feels like Metal gear solid 5 is a single player game at heart and multiplayer is just something little extra especailly if you want to get a couple friends together and find some random games to play. You can use the staging area in the main menu of MGO 3 to practice with weapons and I think any party members can join in and you all can hang around while searching for a game, kind of having your own mini base of operations, so it's not entirely horrible, its just the classes is what ♥♥♥♥ed up the online modes, and that's just something we all have to deal with.  Anyhow, MGS5 is a great damn game with a great damn singeplayer mode. I was really suprised how well the game is optmized and runs pretty smooth. I've already played the game on Xbox one prior to this so I already know most of whats going on as far as the story goes. As far as multiplayer goes, its really ♥♥♥♥ed up, so either you like it or don't kind of deal but otherwise dont take it too seriously like most youtubers do, and just frag it out with 15 other players. done deal.  at the end, I recommend the game, even though the multiplayer may be lackluster but it wasn't enough to bring the whole game down to a negative in my point of view. I think it's better if you get the definitive edition right now before the sales are over, other wise you just spend 39 dollars on the full game when you get the special for 25...i don't know how that makes any sense but whatever.  putting Quiet down with a revolver's last bullet while laying on my back after getting shot up felt somewhat satisfying in multiplayer, i don't know why.",1,0

Everything useful that can be said about this game has probably already been said in the short time since its release, but I'll wrap up with these points:   - You dream about it. I think that's a sign of immersion.  - The action is emergent - you really feel like the game reponds to what you do. Even in the most desperate f-up situation, when you're on your back, firing blindly at blurry targets, when in other games you'd be reaching for the reload, you can always seems to find a way out of the mess. It can be hard, but it can also be forgiving.  - Most days I creep around, scoping out enemies, sneaking about, a tranquilizer here, and stab in the neck there. Other days, I take the tank out. If you haven't played it, please don't think it's any 'on rails' sh*t like 'Thief' or 'Call of Duty' - sure - the main story is sequential, but you can p*ss around to your heart's content in the meantime.  - The graphics are suh-weet.  - Miller is Captain Sensible.

Not sandbox games at all, I had to reload old saves and hang around areas I had already cleared to get my 'emergent narrative' experience. 3 was best for this, it had several really excellent large, open areas in which to screw around with the guards, which is what I come to this series for.  This entry, Phantom Pain, has by far the best gameplay in the series, and in fact some of the best gameplay anywhere. Snake handles like a dream, your playstyle options are numerous to the point of absurdity, and the game, finally a sandbox, is just huge. You can screw with the guards for hundreds of hours in hundreds of different ways if you want.  And I do. Thank you Metal Gear.  And as for all that noise about it being padded and unfinished, consider this- Metal Gear Solids 1-4 are movies. This is a tv show. A tv show on fox, which cancelled it too early. Its the Sarah Connor Chronicles of the Metal Gear universe.  This is among my five favorite games ever.",1,0

And you can feel at which point Kojima was no longer allowed to work as they liked. x..x the ending is rushed. Plot-Lines just go nothing despite it is obvious they were intent to and a lot of little bits tell you the sad story of MGS V, tha last real game Konami will ever produce before they butcher their IPs to become slot-machines. x..x This hurts me as a fan of the convoluted but always passionate story-telling of MGS. I like this game a lot still... but the series deserved a better ending, and it easily would have been if things went like Kojima wanted them to be, without Konami losing its mind.   The Game is good tho. Believe me. But under the circumstances i just can't give it a reccomendation right now...

3553326,289070,Sid Meier's Civilization VI,"Civ VI is hardly good even for a tablet version.  I was super excited while awaiting this game. Civ fun since Civ 2, I can't survive such a huge disappointment. I spent 2 hours playing singleplayer campaign and comparing my impressions with Civ IV and Civ V experience.  The conclusion in unforgiving. Civ VI is less interesting, beautiful and attractive as previous titles. The whole look of the game is disgusting. Low resolution models on a maximum graphics, horrible cartoon unit animations with 'KABOOM' effects and so on.  The interface is cheap and icons are rude. Ah, too much pain writing this.  The development of the city loss the handy interface from Civ V and becomes clunky. This can be appealed to all mechanics. I just can't understand, how this could happen.  AI is just stupid. Barbarians captured the worker and leave it be. He was just standing few turns, I skip few more, nothing changes. Also, they don't like to pillage. Other Civilization start a war with just 1 catapult and warrior, that was standing still. Other Civ starts a war with tons of chariots, that need to overcome like 25 hexes. Only one can managed to do it.    Unfortunately, it seems for me as a degradation of the series: graphics, gameplay and optimizations seems much poorer then in previous titles. So sad. Maybe, they made a tablet version and somehow sold it as full PC release.  Refound.",-1,1
3553734,289070,Sid Meier's Civilization VI,"Civ 6 gameplay in a nutshell:  --Stamp out randomly appearing barbarian camps that instantly spawn throughout the entire game, for no reason other than to annoy you. That one single fog of war tile in the middle of your empire in the industrial age? Yeah, it just spawned a spearman and scout, which then pillaged your trade-route. Because reasons.  --Constantly reapply trade-routes. A tedious task which lasts throughout the entire game, because for whatever reason we are not given manual control of when and where we send trade-routes. Instead we are spammed every handful of turns to reapply them, even if it is the same route you've been using for the last 200 turns. Because reasons.  --Infinite-city-sprawl cities across the map. Sure, you could take time to develop a city by spending 40 turns to build a single district. Or you could just expand 5 more times in the same amount of turns. Have 70% of the map covered in your cities with nothing built but maybe a granary and monument. Oh, don't worry about keeping pace, you will be drowning in science and culture and will be ages above your competition with your stone-age city spam.  --Get insulted by various AI factions throughout the game. It doesn't matter what you do, they will find something to insult you about. Your empire is too big, too small, your military is too large, not large enough, you are too peaceful, you warmonger, you built a wonder, you have a luxury, you simply exist. Don't worry, those randomly spawning barbarian camps pose more of a threat than the AI Civs, so you can safely ignore them and just spam the escape key anytime a diplomatic message comes up.   --After about 200 turns of boredom, exit out of the game. Or you could punish yourself by subjecting yourself to more boredom and complete a victory. It doesn't matter either way, it is impossible to lose this game since the AI is nearly non-existent.  At nearly 4,000 hours of Civ 5, I cannot recommend getting Civ 6. It took all the flaws of Civ 5 and brought them back, and in many cases made them worse (terrible AI, crowded map with 1UPT, poor performance especially on larger maps). And yet, it hasn't really improved anything at all. The religion system is arguably worse, graphics are an eye-sore to many of us, meaningful choices are few and far between, the numbers are way off across the board (ridiculous production costs, move way too fast through tech/civics even while purposely ignoring science/culture).  Long story short: Maybe after several patches, paid dlc, and expansions it will be close enough to Civ 5 to be playable. Maybe.

Some bonus items should be luxury (Crabs are luxuries... think of real life. Who eats crab normally?)  The lack of team ability at launch wrecked the whole game for me. I delight in playing with my friends, and them taking this out in the 11th hour constitutes fraud and make furious.  Religion is beyond overpowered. I disable Religious Victory every time because every single time, within a few turns swarms (at one count, 15 at once) missionaries/apostles group in cities and get a quick victory. It takes away from actually planning your game.   CONSTANT reconnections required from multi-player where players DeSync makes online play virtually impossible.

3556750,289070,Sid Meier's Civilization VI,"City spam, from the days of yore, is back! There's no global happiness, and neither Science/Culture become more expensive with more citites. Thus, it's optimal to continuously build Settlers as long as there are any valid places to build a city. Don't worry about putting the city near luxury resources: the cities share them!  This sucks, and makes the game much less fun. That's my main complaint. Other, lesser complaints:  1. AI take their actions very slowly. Near the end of my game, each turn took a full 2.5 minutes. This is painful, especially when you're just hitting 'End Turn' a few turns in a row. 2. Leaders are not very diverse. Civ 5 had neat weird stuff like Venice, which completely changed the game. In Civ 6, each country has one slightly better building, and one slightly better military unit. Granted, this will likely improve over time with DLC. 3. In order to assign Fixed Teams from Multiplayer, you have to edit config files. Manageable, but sloppy.  I'll give credit where credit is due: there are a lot of good ideas in here.

3558925,289070,Sid Meier's Civilization VI,"1) Bugs. They're around. Annoying. Multiplayer is slow with them. *Edit: I do not list individual bugs. I don't believe reviews are a place for me to list every bug and how I found it. That's the purpose of a bug report, not a review. I will simply tell you they exist, and they are annoying. If you are playing and aren't experiencing bugs. Great. Judging by the bug section on CivFanatics though, there are definitely bugs and other people are getting them too.  2) The Graphics. It was, and is my biggest complaint about the game.  3) You can't rename your cities, your civilization, or the continents. Continents names are weird and their placement is inconsistent with the definition of a continent.  4) The quote for Kilimanjaro: 'As it turns out, Mount Kilimanjaro is not wi-fi enabled, so I had to spend two weeks in Tanzania talking to people on my trip.' - Some blogger named Nancy Bonds. That's right. The source of the Nile, life for the egyptian people, and the best they could find was a quote made by a blogger on vacation. Nothing on Meyers, who first climbed Kilimanjaro, or a quote by people who actually live/lived there.   5) You can't save your map settings, so every game you play you have to make sure you change back the settings. This becomes really annoying in point 6.  6) You can't 'Restart' a game to muligan the map. This is incredibly annoying as you sometimes end up with a bad spot and you just don't want to even attempt it.  7) District system means each city is limited in the amount of wonders you can build per city. Though I wasn't a fan of the 'optimal strategy' of 4 cities in Civ 5, or the Massive sprawl of earlier civs, the game seems to want to force you to sprawl out without rewarding you for this decision. (Building tall is much harder and impractical for victory)  8) No advanced options for things like raging barbarians, and the new 'victory' setting is just diplomacy renamed to religion. Religious units now fight eachother with magic. Another new victory setting is score - So now they encourage an end limit to your game.  *edit: Victory setting, meaning that this is a default-on option, which I have to turn off. I do not believe a score-victory or timer victory was a victory condition I've ever seen played or win by me or my friends.   9) 6 map types. No Earth-like map types, no 'Small continents' vs. 'Large Island' varieties. Fractal is pretty close to generating earth-like maps, except when it doesn't.  10) Two greece leaders, no Babylon. The leaders idea was good, just a bit lacklustre in choices at the moment. DLC will fix, at the cost of the original price of the game you paid for.  This game can be summed up as bad design choices, terrible UI, a civilopedia which sometimes doesn't match the game, poor wording, and ethical principles from 2016 introduced into a game about civilization.   See. I started my game, my eyes already burning from the pastel colours and the graphic designs borrowed from Age of Empires Online and the first thing I do is wander across the fog of war (which really is the prettiest thing about the game.) as my screen jerks away from my control to the natural wonder I discovered. Sean Bean's voice proclaiming prior quote proudly. My thought: 'Well, there goes any immersion I could have had.' - Seriously, I'm in the ancient era, running with clubs. Who is Nancy Bonds, and why the hell am I hearing a quote about her? Nothing inspiring, no famous quote or person from history... It's just a weird sudden shock. On top of the fact that I can't rename anything in this game, I'm pretty much left with 'History Simulator: We give less choices and less immersion to your experience.'  - What followed was pretty embarassing. An AI player was defeated (Less than 30 turns in, in fact) and the Barbarians (Which I play on Raging in Civilization 5, On king difficulty or higher) and they were -running- away from my warriors. I don't know if it was a weird coincidence, but if I am not being challenged by a game (on Prince or above) in any way, than there isn't a point for me to play it.  To top it off, my multiplayer games have been plagued by desyncs and stuttering issues. My suggestion - Civilization 5 and wait for the bug fixes and first 'Expansion.'  *edit: For those of you don't understand why I'm hating on the quotes is two fold:  a) It's a design philosophy.  b) Sarcasm is easy, wit is not. Sarcasm does not equate to wit. Hell, the quote they are refering to is taken out of context and changed the meaning entirely, as I was later informed. I am playing a game about history, the dawn of civilization and mankinds trek through it. I wished to be immersed into the world, or at the very least, find it partially informative. If you have no problem with quotes like that: Great! I'm sure other people out there enjoy other things than my tastes. I, however, enjoy the works of Virgil, Homer, Kong Qiu, and Motoori Norigana. I want to experience other cultures and see mankind in a positive light and share in the vast wisdom of humanity. If you have a game about other cultures, why not share a unique experience without being cheap about it? People live in these places, it's a breathing world. By destroying my perceptions in a game, by ruining my immersion - It cheapens my experience and makes it overall less fun for me. If you don't agree, I respect your opinion but I believe the game would be better for the collective experience. I believe mankind is better than that.  @illPosedProblem: Brian Reynolds doing the writing would be fantastic. SMAC is an amazing game.",-1,1

3565750,289130,ENDLESS™ Legend,"Being a 4X strategy, Civilization is the first thing that pops in your mind when looking at Endless Legend. I've postponed this game for long, ignoring my friends' good opinions. In retrospective, I couldn't be more wrong with this one.  As the third (if I get it right) installment in the Endless universe, Endless Legend is lacking in more that one place. Tech tree in the late game is dull: it's essentially nothing more that bigger numbers. Numerous places lack polish - for example, you can merge 'anonymous' privateer armies and armies openly carrying your banners without any restrictions. Balance is out there somewhere, but its existance is questioned, and rightfully so. Diplomacy, while good, still leaves more to wish for (a mod for freely trading cities, an illogical worsening of relations when you greatly outnumber your competitors in military - just to name a few). Uncompleteable quests (like asking to bring a settler from Cultists). No sea combat means that any water is a 'safe zone' where you can easily hide from an outnumbering foe (or vice versa). It is a flawed game, and the devs have a long way to go.  Yet at the same time it's a great game, nevermind the obvious (or less obvious) flaws. The lore is what made me cry from joy like a teenage girl. Where else can you find valorous knights with vampiric powers? The whole nation of hikikomori basement dwellers? A transgender hero? Quests are strong with this one. Aside from typical fetch and kill, there are more unique ones, like 'conquer that region', which becomes a real challenge (especially if that region belongs to your old ally). You need resources? There is more than one solution. Search the ruins. Conquer resource-rich regions. Make more money and buy on a market with floating prices. Trade with your neighbours. Complete quests offering resource rewards. Every nation is unique and has a unique questline, making gameplay completely different. Cultists have only one city and, as such, only one region, but every converted village brings them a piece of region's resources. Vaulters can drop reinforcements across half of the continent into the besieged city. Broken Lords easily buy out settlers, population and buildings, expanding at lightspeed. There are many more things to mention. Battle tactics, the relief that does have significance. I've standed severely outnumbered in a narrow mountain pass, 300 vaulter crossbowmen versus cavalry armada - and won. I've stormed cities with privateer armies and plundered rare resources, not being able to buy them. You are no god, and not all of your commands can be executed as the situation on the battlefield is fluid, but that's only realistic. I like to describe Endless Legend as 'Civilization meets Disciples', but in truth, roleplaying system is akin to many strategy/RPG crossbreeds out there, while still being unique. You can make a combat hero, or a city governor hero. Or a little of both. You can get your troops reequipped, making archers more mobile or changing cavalry focus from ranged slayers to infantry slayers. Every hero class has its features, and heroes from different nations also differ. And then there's Winter. Winter is coming, and it can be either your greatest foe... or the most valuable ally.  Endless Legend is that long-welcome taste of something new. And while it is not perfect, it honestly strives to be good, and it's quite successful at that. See you on Auriga. The planet that still gives me chills.  'I am many things. I have been many things.'",1,0

3574537,289650,Assassin's Creed Unity,"I love AC. I've loved the series ever since the first installment. There has always been a good mix of storytelling, game mechanics, and lore to keep me interested. As far as that goes, Unity is no different. It offers a good (though not groundbreaking in any way) addition to the overall story, updated control system and animations, and it sits well in the series' continuity. There are a few gripes I have with it on this front, but those are entirely creative differences, and I am totally willing to accept the developer's right to tell the story they want to tell.   The things I can't forgive are entirely technical. Admittedly, my rig is under the minimum requirements, but this is a boat shared by almost everyone, because the minimum system requirements are a farce. It is ridiculous to release a multiplatform game and expect that players on one platform will have to provide horsepower orders of magnitude higher than those on other platforms. I could have accepted the performance that I get with my system, if the game showed any regard for the graphical settings I chose to run.  For example: On Low graphics preset, with antialiasing off; I average 20 fps in most situations. (Whatever, I'm below the minimum as recommended by the publishers, if I have to live with that so be it). On UltraHigh graphics preset, with fxaa on; I average about 19 fps in most situations, with no real difference in playability when compared to low. (Admittedly a higher setting of AA does bring down the fps. Just putting this here for compleness' sake)  This is ridiculous. If the game had tanked to 5 fps on ultra, I could call it a day and have fun with 20 fps, knowing that my equipment is really being pushed to its limit and delivering the best experience it can. This is obviously not the case, and for that I am disappointed.  The game is gorgeous, the controls feel natural and for-the-most-part fluid, and the co-op is super fun. But this game is in beta, at best. At this point in time, it is not worth any money. I very highly recommend all of the previous AC games; I, II, Brotherhood, Revelations, III, and IV, are all fantastic games. I would really love to recommend this game for the story, but there is a very, very small demographic that would find the price tag worth it for the story alone. If Ubi patches this game to where it runs smoothly, AC:U would probably be my top game of the year; but as it stands, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game for anyone.",-1,0

3577857,290080,Life is Feudal: Your Own,"********************** Edit After the developer response i thought i'd give the game another run through.  I tried to keep an open mind, especially (and surprisingly) now the game has left Early Access; and visually i thought it was much better.   However - after spending 15 minutes fine tuning myself in the updated character creator while joining a server, i received the message 'you cannot use this name'. This happened twice, until i went with the default character with the name 'ILBAsdbasd askdjsjjs' of which the game was much happier to allow.  Anyway; I walked around, there were several frame rate drops that were temporary but nothing bad. A lot of effort has indeed been put into the aesthetic with a much more streamlined UI.  I managed to squeeze in another 5 minutes before:  'Life is Feudal encountered an error and needs to close down'  My breif edit and response to Saxxon is as follows.  I was highly surprised before even starting the game that you made the decision to leave Early Access. The game runs smoother, i did notice.. However i was able to play even LESS of your game than i was back in June.  Regarding the comment about my issues being with the servers and 'not the game itself'. I can't understand how that salvages anything. The game is only accessible through these servers, especially for new players.  However you are correct and many of the issues i originally encountered have been fixed.  But if i bought this game now, in 'release version' and was unable to play due to the crash i wouldn't really give a flying **** about mining a tunnel.  ************************************  Original Review:  After spending nearly 40 hours trying to get myself started on this game (over the course of 2015) i've just had to give up!  Here's one example. To build a warehouse to store anything, you need a ton of metal ingots. To get ingots, you need to mine. However, after joining many servers hoping to find a stable playing environment (some servers don't load, others you get kicked for not speaking their native language) i was banned for simply mining.  Turns out mining for metal causes lag for the rest of the server, who knew? So after finally finding another stable server, speaking my native language, i asked what the 'work-around' was for gathering metal. The response was 'An admin needs to build an 'infinite pile' for you'. However, the admin of this server was sick and wouldn't be on for a month, poor guy. You won't be able to continue with your mining skill progression either, unless an admin cheats this for you.  Eventually, i got my 'infinite pile' of resources and my mining skill was boosted for me. At this point, i felt like i had cheated the game. The last few hours of my time with Life is Feudal felt cheap, cheesed.. And upon rejoining the server after a little over a day, everything i'd built was on fire. This was due to the decay system that's been introduced to remove trash. I had spent hours trying to build my house and a warehouse, which was now defined by the game as 'trash'.   All in all, if you are very lucky and find a stable server and don't mind cheating the game for resources, then you'll probably enjoy it. Just be aware about inviting a friend to purchase the game too, as they might not even be able to join the same servers as you.  For me, i won't be revisiting Life is Feudal until these game breaking flaws are resolved.    ---------------- On a side note 'This Early Access game is not complete and [may or may not change further]' Shouldn't this be illegal? I mean, everyone knows early access is a big cash cow for most devs, as well as Steam..  Yet a good analogy would be to pay for a 3 course meal at a restaurant, sit down &amp; receive your starter but nothing else.  Maybe i'm just hungry.",-1,1

3587453,290770,The Fall,My first impression was that game would be something like limbo(action game) or swapper(puzzle game). It's strange that developers decided to make a hybrid between point&amp;click and shooter. It feels like they prototyped guns and decided to leave them in because it was too much work to finish the proper action game. As a result the game features unique UI for adventure game. It was a real pain to use. Upgrade screen also seems like unfinished metroidvania idea. Shooting does not work - it's not fun. It's easy and just serves as action filler between proper adventure sections.  Adventure component works reasonably well. I think I get the main narrative point about breaking the rules. Visuals and voice acting are really good.  I can only recommend this game to people who want to better understand how hard it is to design a game outside of existing genre.,-1,0
3589015,290790,Grey Goo,"Disclaimer: I didn't like it.

Biggest idiocy:   The humans attack the Beta because they try to make contact? While conducting an exploratory mission? The humans take the rogue nano on their main ship, and it just destroys it? Who commands this mission? Captain Dumb and Three Stoges?    Units are very meh. Almost nothing that makes you feel powerful. Everything feels pretty... noncosequential, even explosions are mediocre and without spice. Ok - one unit is awesome. The Hand of Rukh. The rest are variations of the same, really.

3601480,291480,Warface,"WOW. I have not had this much fun in an fps for a long time. I have a pc that can not run most games and I am getting 40-60 fps in this game. This game is veeeery fun. The teammates are a bit weird though. Every once in a while you get that one guy how will revive you or give you more ammo. And for guy who has never played MW1.2, or 3 this is very epic. One of the only issues I have had with this game is even if I exit the game, the launcher is still open. This game would be even more fun if you had some buddy's who played this as well.

3601682,291480,Warface,"Played for an hour, can't take anymore. It's so boring. I don't think I'm being too critical about f2p shooters. I played and enjoyed other f2p shooters like Hawken, and ghost recon online. They have some type of personality. This game though, is just devoid of soul. I don't know what it is. Could be the mute/lackluster sounds, the overly generic graphics, or just a non-vocal community (ingame) but I feel like sleeping when I play this. Not to add that it seems to have a very heavy P2W model. Back to CSGO where every game has some excitement and thrill. Maybe it just needs guns skins ;). I hope the developers add some type of spice to this game.",-1,0
3601870,291480,Warface,"It came as a surprise for me to see this game on Steam in BETA. I remember playing it a couple of years ago in Russia on a distribution platform called Games Mail.ru.   The game was fun and at that point it seemed good if it was not a freemium game where to really play you need to pay more than you would pay for CoD or CS:GO, which are much better games. Now playing it again after these years on Steam and seeing that it has a BETA badge I am surprised.It has not changed a lot and I feel there is no effort put to improve it. Besides what annoys me that I get message that I am running out of memory when playing it. I played the version on Mail.ru and it never did that. Maybe it has something to do with my newer PC, but other games work fine such as Assassin's Creed 4 and Witcher 2, or other FPS games such as CS:GO.   This game is very dissapointing. It feels that it is just another way to milk money from consumers for nothing.",-1,0

I never died planting bombs, I was never involved in a psyopathic show of individual mass murder. This game degrades my character and I regret my decision of doing business with CryTek and wish I had sold the game rights to a dev that is more focused on RPGs, such as Obsidian.

3604342,291480,Warface,"I want to say this, the game has in some respects improved from what it was originally and i feel that it's a game that if it puts more variety into it's missions on PvE it could become fantastic. The game in areas is P2W but i saw that every gun that is ingame money purchasable is just as powerful as guns you can get with paid money. That being said the game is overall a bit clunky. The community for the game is a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥, not that the people aren't nice, they just don't understand the word team and end up ♥♥♥♥ing things up for you and your team, also i came into a game where as soon as it started the guy threw a grenade in the helicopter, died and then quit and also a guy who ran into the line of a sniper and got killed then raged and quit. As you can see that the community here is a bit ♥♥♥♥ to say the least. I think the concept and gameplay of the game is good and i like alot of it's features, but i think it lacks in areas that are fundamental, i have'nt given the PvP a go but from what i've heard it's lackluster. There's good replayability and it could be an amazing game and in my opinion apart from some of it's negative areas it is, but for now i'm not going to recommend, i may play this game on the odd occassion to see what new things have been added, but it's not a game that i would want to play for hours on end.",-1,0

3604802,291480,Warface,"Play a couple of rounds and that was awfully painful. It took me longer to get the game actually running then the matches itself. Now once inside the game the framrates are really awful and random. With all my drivers up to date I found it odd the game would run for a sec and then lag. I fixed this problem by slightly lowering the shadows and effects quality. By changing it just below high it automaticlly ran how it should. Really odd if you ask me. Onto the game. The AI is really weird, they dont actually pose threats to you as you could just hide behind something and shoot them a few times. Easy score. However even the maps seemed to be very glitchy. Bodies glitching in and out of the ground along with sounds sometimes doing the same. However we can say, its in Beta so thats alright I dont expect too much. Here is where I judge this game fully. Total Biscuit is very clear on this as well. Games that charge you in game money and then attempt to consider themseleves 'alpha' or 'beta' no longer matters. Im going to judge this game as a full game. You dont charge people money for something that doesnt work right. The game was already trying to shove boosters on me after training.

3638525,292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"tl;dr version I fought 12 wolves while drunk on beer with an onion in my left hand and casting hypnosis to watch them maul each other. And I ate their livers and went to the next town to sell of their furs. Saw a lone sack on the road and grabbed a single mug inside and the guards instantly drew their swords and spears to me. And thus ends Geralt of Rivia's adventure.  Will expand review upon finishing. My initial impressions while play at 'Blood and Broken Bones!' difficulty :  - Took me 8 hours for the tutorial map and I haven't even finished half of the next map. - As of 1.04 patch, it runs at 60fps on most areas on high settings with none of the blurry postprocessing effects. GTX 770 and an i5 3570. Applying NVIDIA shampoo on everyone isn't worth it and so is the postprocessing camera effects. - The land, atmosphere, view is beautiful. The forests really feel like a forest with large trees casting a shadow and with little sky to see. The swamps feel like a swamp but not exactly dirty though. - Most of the quests and side-quests are absolutely entertaining. Writing is for debate but it really does entertain you. - The card game. Gwent. It's an improvement over the dice in 2. You will hate it for somewhat being luck-based (like all card games, I guess), but you will love it for its simple gameplay and depth. - The gameplay feels like Witcher 2, except in a wider area. You'll probably find most of the time, you're rolling or sidestepping away and then striking back since the items (bombs, crossbows) feel a bit clunky and awkward to use. - The use of potions seems to be. uh, don't know how to word it, is used casually this time when compared to the previous installments wherein you know you'll use them when you're expecting to fight something big. - Geralt can now swim! And dive! And, and, shoot crossbows underwater. - You can call upon your magic horse anytime. - Enemies don't level scale. From what I've experienced anyway. As there are certain areas you're not meant to go because a professional monster slayer who has survived dragon attacks and mutants may have difficulty on defeating a high level rabid mutt. - Health doesn't regenerate. You have to rely on potions and tons of food to restore health. I haven't tried long meditations though. - Overall, it feels like the game has been streamlined, gameplay-wise. Objective markers, refillable items, and such. The game literally tells you what to do to advance the quest.",1,0

3644821,292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"So I bought this game in July 2016 summer sales for 25 euro.  The game is great. Reminds me of Skyrim, but with better graphics, better combat, and a better story.  Summarized: Story 10/10 Not just the main quests, but also every side quest is worked out very well with their own cutscenes and choices to make in dialogue. Choices you get to make during quests often have MAJOR impact which is great. Nearly EVERYTING is narrated. The story is full of humor (even though the world of the Witcher seems silly enough at times) but it's not overdone. Everything from the lore to the quests to the dialogue and narration is perfect for me.  Combat 9/10 Combat is pretty smooth. Your main character, Geralt, has access to some basic magic spells which come in handy to beat specific supernatural opponents. You can select a different spell in combat: holding the switch button will slow down time and you can pick a new spell in this kind of quick-start menu. You also have crossbows and bombs which I never use in combat. Apparently Witchers traditionally fight just with swords and spells so I try to stick with that and it works fine. There are some interesting interactions like counterattack, parry and dodge. Main attacks are quick attack and strong attack.  Character progression/customization 7/10 First of, there is no crafting armor or weapons in this game. At least, no crafting by your character. You can find blueprints that you bring to armorsmithis or weaponsmiths and if THEY are skilled enough they will craft it for you for a fee. During the game I found out that to get a better medium armor I needed to save the original chestpiece Geralt had on when you start the game, but I sold that early on. So now I cant have the armorsmith craft me the next step in medium armor -.-. I wouldve liked to craft things myself, at least weapon and armor. You can however craft your own potions, but there is no real 'alchemy' level or anything like that in which you can grow.  The progression of your character in game mainly consists of leveling up by doing quests (which is slow, but fine). Every level seems to take the same amount of experience, so its not like you level up quick at first, and then have to grind for ages to go max out. You can use the level up points to invest in traits for combat, spells or the use of potions etc. I wouldve wished for a little more adaptivity like being able to use copy skins from armor to armor, now Im stuck with my ugly wool sweater but it has the best stats so Im just going to run it anyway. Also a little more crafting would be awesome.  Atmosphere 8/10 The atmtosphere created in the game by extensive narration of the common folk and the main characters as well as the design and the graphics is amazing. I can't run on ultra, but I run everything on high and my game looks great. The weather changes constantly and the world of Witcher 3 responds to it: if its windy trees will bend etc. Also the day and night cycle is apparant because it goes dark (obviously) and different creatures come out at night.

Best upgrade you can do to a budget system unless your rig can already fold spacetime. Then buy and play this game.  The developers have thrown an AWESOME amount of free DLC already at this. The game is HUGE, the gameplay is satisfying with many 'OH MAN THAT WAS SO AMAZINGLY COOL!' moments. The facial animations are the best I've ever seen in actual gameplay. The writing is fantastic.  If you like wading into a group of bad people as a sword wielding maniac or someone who is a living flamethrower this game is for you. Actually, unless your game HAS to have firearms in it, it's for you. Seriously, you have, like, ten different kinds of grenades, telekenesis, crossbows, and who knows what else.  This raises the bar so high, most games can't even see it for the clouds.  It also fixes MANY things that hung up people on the first two.",1,0

I will not try and say that The Witcher 3 is better than Skyrim, nor will I try and say that Skyrim is better than The Witcher 3, because I recommend both equally, and they cater to slightly different playstyles, but The Witcher 3 is a lot more immersive, because of its excellent models and animation avoiding the Uncanny Valley and its massive, believable world, which seems to have the same amount of love put into every aspect. One thing I liked to do was to look at the map, which has question marks for locations you haven't visited, and visit every single place until no question marks remained.  This is not a game to rush. You want to take your time, do what you want when you want, explore. And even if you do rush it, I think the fastest time this game has been completed in is 25 hours. This is very long, but in a good way. I have not got anywhere near the end, as you can see by my measly 26 hours in this game, but I can say all of this already.  Also, the music is fantastic.

I am 7 hours into the game, and I feel that is plenty of time to establish some other interesting elements to the game. The art direction is awesome, I enjoy the voice acting, and otherwise the world and story is interesting, but, Final Fantasy XIII in my opinion leaves a lot to be desired.",-1,0

At least the modding comunnity stepped up and already fixed some issues (they fixed it in 48h and are not even payed for that), Should have downloaded the torrent and donated my money to the modders.

3668450,292140,FINAL FANTASY XIII-2,"I outgrew liking JRPGs years ago now; they're too tedious and filled with too much nonsense...and yet I keep subjecting myself to them out of some oddly stubborn nostalgia and a kind of academic curiosity.  While I didn't particularly like how FFXIII (the original) played and found the story filled with far too much gobbledygook to be compelling, I at least found things to like in some of the characters and the spectacle of it all (impressive cutscenes, settings, etc).  FFXIII-2 is a game that I think fans of the genre would identify as better playing due to the more immediate access to its various systems. However, it's still an absolute grind fest if you want to exploit the upper limit of what the game has to offer (extra hard optional bosses and such) - and if you don't, then the game is still more or less on autopilot just like FFXIII.  As the gameplay doesn't appeal to me, what I've got left is the characters, story, and aesthetics - all of which I found lacking. Noel and Sarah are little bland; the villain is much better, but they're all entangled in a story built of such nonsense that it's hard to empathize with any of them. The settings and presentation don't compare to a proper full FF game either.  On top of all that, there are few rather despicable elements to this game that seem to actively hate its players. In particular, there's a casino in the game which has a slot machine - with odds of winning that seem barely better than real life. Getting the game's bonus 'true' ending is reliant (in part) on winning a big payout from this slot machine - something which is entirely random and no in any way influenced by player skill. This is completely ridiculous. It's the worst kind of creatively bankrupt time sink and completely disrespectful to players. Even if I don't care about the bonus ending because I'll just watch a video of it, the mere presence of something as insulting as completion being tied to a random number generator casts a shadow over the whole game.    Finally, as noted by many other reviews, the performance is unacceptable to the extent that it does impact enjoyment of the game. The game is internally locked to running either 30fps or 60fps because the gameplay engine is tightly coupled to the renderer and they hacked in 60fps support simply by halving the gameplay simulation speed and then only allowing the game to run at these two framerates instead of more sensibly decoupling the renderer from gameplay simulation.  That still wouldn't be too be to bad if the game could maintain 60fps all the time, but even on hardware that should be more than sufficient to run the game at a solid 60fps (4790K and GTX 970), it will constantly jump between 30fps and 60fps depending how much is on screen. The frequent changes in framerate are jarring and arguably worse than if the game was simply locked to 30fps.  I'm going to suffer through it and see it to the end because I'm stubborn and compulsive about finishing games I start, but it's going to be a struggle for sure.",-1,0
3668881,292180,X-Plane 10 Global - 64 Bit,"I have spent a lot of time with FSX (No graphics add-on) and I use these softwares for simulation NOT FOR GAMING.

(Much detailed.) -Little bit better sounds.   Cons:  -Really really bad joystick optimization. -ATC, it is bad as, 123. -Airports which are not coming with stock, only taxiways and runways. -FSX has better add-on support. -FSX comes with much more stock planes. (You can add a lot of planes for X-Plane for free. Still you have to pay for really detailed planes for both games.) -FSX much cheaper on Steam. (I bought FSX for 8 Turkish Lira, X-Plane 10 for 44,5 Turkish Lira. 1$=2.70 TRY)   I will go on with X-Plane because it is running good on my PC. (FX6300, R9 270) In the other hand, we can not use FSX Steam version for VATSIM or IVAO. You can use VATSIM or IVAO for X-Plane easily.

Yet another benign entry into the FPS genre that carries with it the Call of Duty franchise tag -- the tag that has sold these games, every year they release, since MW because of the nostalga that game evokes. MW was good, so was MW2 and even BO1. Then the games started being about that big payday, buying positive reviews, and less about the love of what went into the originals. I think people who purchase COD games, like myself, do it because we romanticize about just how good the original games were without ever really stopping to acknowledging how mediocre and inconsistant every other release of the franchise has been.  These games either need to find developers who can muster their love of story telling and game play and set the course straight, or they need to let them die a peaceful death.

Now since they announced they were remastering the game, i was like hell yeah ill like to play the game that I use to come home from school to play again. But you know, they need to stop.  Infinite Warfare. Its not a bad game, but please stop making these futureristic ♥♥♥♥♥ of games. We are sick of it. I only bought this game to get MW remastered. Played a mission or two of the campaign, eh its fine, Ill finish it later on in the future. But obvisouly you buy the game to play online, and oh man its horrible. Noone plays anything except for Domination and Team Deathmatch which get boring as hell. I want to play FFA but again noone plays it. Plus they dont even have SnD?! Like wtf? So thats a huge let down. Plus the guns feels the same to me and the maps are so not memoriable. Zombies, idk its mixed for me. Like its pretty obvious you guys are not taking it serious and you will never be able to top Black Ops Zombies, sorry but not sorry. I mean its okay for the most part, but its just no. Just no.   Modern Warfare Remastered. Yes it is gorgeous. Same everything. Of course this is the only reason why I bought this game. Do I regret it? Hell yes. Again, noone plays anything but Team Deathmatch and Dom. Like come on guys? Headqaurters was the ♥♥♥♥ and easiest way to level up and noone even knows about it. Speaking playing.. I really ♥♥♥♥ing wish I can play it on at least NORMAL ♥♥♥♥ING SETTINGS!! I can only play the game on low settings with no shadows, with no blood, no nothing, and i have a decent computer Specs.

The game is perfectly fine its a pretty much full package.  Single Player: Its pretty amazing but its for sure one the better CoD Stories, they manage to keep it feeling futuristic but it also feels very much CoD like but has quite a few big Sci-Fi moments in it. Its a pretty evenly paced Campaign, and it really works for CoD. Its a very simple and easy to play campaign, the story is pretty good but it does fall short sometimes.  Multiplayer: Its pretty good and solid, it feels sort of different but is not as fresh and I wish it would be, I was really hoping this CoD would be the one that pulls me back into the franchise. The multiplayer is fun in short bursts, at this point its a taste thing if youre into tons of quick action you will love the multiplayer. I do enjoy the more character based classes just like BO3 had. Most of the special abilities are pretty cool, and then crafting is somewhat new and cool. Scorestreaks dont feel too OP. The multiplayer is MUCH more grinding... then other CoD's. Will fans love this game? Yes.  Best way to explain this, BO3 and Advanced Warfare had a baby.  Zombies: Zombies is a bit fun I do not lvoe Zombies too much but I can see the Zombies people will love this version of Zombies.  Modern Warfare Remastered: Wow. I'm in love so nostalgic the textures and lighting makes everything feel so amazing. I totally love this and I think you should for sure get this if you played COD4 because MWR feels the EXACT same, as CoD4.

Boy was I wrong, I've yet to finish it, but if it turns out that the scene in the trailer isn't even in the game, I'm gonna have to type some angry letters.  The game is plain boring, it's a little bit unsettling at first, for maybe 1 minute, untill you realize that the narrator is just throwing random words at you about demons, angels and 'Oohhh I'm so poetic' bullhonkey.  It almost got eerie at one part, when the music stopped, but it was just preparing to loop.  I've always hated how in Amnesia when you press shift, you run. This game got it right, and made it so you walk EEEVEEN slower by holding shift, so when you walk the wrong way or have to backtrack, you can't do so quickly. I am NOT being serious.  The 'cinematics' are horrible too, I don't even want to call them cinematics, because it's like they recorded themselves playing their own game with fraps and slapped it in the game. Infact I bet that's what they did, because whoevers computer it was, must've had a hard time, judging by the jitteryness.  Just like Amnesia, the game takes control of your view once in a while, expect Amnesia allowed you to still look away, and the camera was a lot smoother. In this game, the camera dashes to a random location in which I assume a noise came from.  The only reason I got a bit scared was because the camera went 'WHOSH!' on me, I would've been more afraid had I just heard the noise, leaving me to wonder 'What the balloney was that?'  The game effects are also bad, either there is too much blur, or there isn't enough. There is also a line going up and down my screen when playing this, like when you rewind a VHS tape.    I'm sorry, but this game is not good, is not. No.  I have some very harsh words to say about this game, but in order of being polite, I'll just say.. Don't bother, even if it's cheap.

You can play for free until you become level 10, (You can still play, but not advance on your main xp) then you have to subscribe to a monthly membership. There are two kinds of progression, the XP and SP. you get SP (skill points) for certian missions, such as cooking, science, depending on which chacters you speak to. These missions and skills can be played and leveled forever Some of the characters require you to be a certain level to speak with them (XP lvl), and that's the one that will only get to level 10 for free players  It's a cute MMO, or just MO, it is not that massive. You run around questing, doing different mini games, chat with others, decorate you house, or whatever you feel like. decorations and outfits can be earned doing quest, or be bought using either in-game cash or eshop coins.

3696249,294440,Shadowgate,"I was excited to see yet another old game I played on NES had been remade and released on Steam (the other being Gauntlet)! The original was released in 1989 on the NES, and was a lot of fun (though very difficult) when I played it as a kid.   The new one is just as tough, and has a new and very beautiful art style. A nice soundtrack was made for this as well, though after exploring the options menu I saw there were options to make this game feel more like the original, 'retro' Shadowgate. One of those options was to have the old soundtrack play instead! There's other options as well to make it feel more like the old version. They did good there.  So what is this game...well it's an old school point-and-click adventure game. Extremely heavy puzzle elements that will get you killed and/or confused. A lot. There are ways for you to fail this game, without you even knowing it right away too. You'll be unlocking new areas, as well as a fair amount of backtracking. There are also a lot of items to be had, you'll want to get most of them because you never know when they might be of use.  They've introduced some different difficulty settings, and the ability to either play the game with no saves or with the ability to save. Unless you have the hints option on, there's really not much in the way of handholding. And even with the hints, it doesn't really tell you much.  Great game, and worth checking out if you like games that really make you think and pay attention to details.  'It's a sad thing that your adventures have ended here.' Get used to seeing that a lot.",1,0

3699156,294860,Valkyria Chronicles™,"I don't think I've ever seen a combat system that is so teribly much based on rock paper scissors...handgrenade kills a scout, but does 5% dmg on a lancer. Shocktroopers kill heavily armored soldiers within 15 meters easily, but if they're 18m away, they only do like 3% dmg ?! This is ridiculous. Bottom line is, you exactly need to know in advance what's happening and what troops you'll need and where, or you won't stand much of a chance. Either be ready for some serious try-and-error or read a walkthrough before every mission.  The story itself is nice, and I like the idea of having extra skirmishes to level up, but the combat system is just a shame.",1,0

Had a ramp in one of the later missions just not work but still eat up AP. Overall, the game is dated so I guess it was 'good for its time'. Nonetheless, if you like tactical strategy, you can't pass this game up.  UPDATE: Finished the game, started a new game plus, only to find the next day that the save file vanished. Some bugs are just unforgivable. If you think it's okay to pay for a buggy game, go for it. I don't think the game is good enough to warrant putting up with a crappy port.

3703028,295550,,"I thought i would like this game, as my girlfriend talked wonders about it. and it looked promising, but theres a few things that spoke out ot me after a few days of playing it.  Its a classic 'Pay2Win' MMORPG like Forsaken World or PerfectWorld.  now that wouldnt bother me as much, if it didnt have a huge payment wall right at level 20 when you have to pick a subclass. I was a warrior, and i wanted to be a Dark Knight. There were 2 options to become one. 1. i could kill a room full of mobs and then kill the 'Horrid Beast' or i could go grind for a few hours, collecting 65 peices of grass. I picked the faster, and obvious, Horrid Beast line. So i clean out the room rather easily and then get ready for the beast. well the beast killed me and i respawned. so i started strategizing and saw that potions heal instantly and i can be in combat, so i get the 100% health potion and i bought a very expensive Energy restoration potion from the market and try again.. and again... and again.. because no matter how many times you try, you cannot kill this monster. I had the best gear i could get, i spent hours grinding levels and weapons and i even bought the Welcome Pack.   Not to mention the countless payment walls i noticed. Bag space is limited to about 15 slots, you can extend your bag if you pay with 'Reals' which are the premium currency. theres a premium shop full of gear and stuff you could buy, not to mention the other 2 'Dlc' items that add gear and stuff to your account. If you want anything in this game, you have to buy it.  *EDIT* So ive been getting comments (Like Kez1304, stating that since i had 2 options of getting an objective done that its not 'pay to win'. first off, thats completely and utterly false. its a paywall, a very classic example of a paywall. And on top of that, he said that i didnt spend a dime on the game, so let me clarify.), which i have deleted because steam does not allow comment replies, and most people are spineless and dont allow comments on their profile. I had bought 2/3 DLC packs, which gave me a very powerful edge on the gameplay. Potions, armor, weapons, items, mounts.. all in one pack. On top of that, most items in game cost gold, which is really hard to grind........ unless you buy it with the premium currency.",-1,1

3705601,295790,Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna),"The first time I saw the game trailer, I was really excited to play the game (especially since I got it on sale for $3). Unfortunately though, this game failed to reach expectations and I got quite bored in the first hour of gameplay. I played the game alone so controlling and switching between the Fox and Nuna was quite bothersome. I often got frustrated at the puzzles mainly because playing alone is kind of glitchy (Fox follows Nuna if you are Nuna and Nuna follows Fox if you are Fox) so often times the character I  wasn't  controlling got hit by the obstacles, jumped/fell off the platform, etc.   The whole Bola thing was quite frustrating too. Not only is the aiming mechanism REALLY weird (you have to indicate where the Bola where go   JUST  with Nuna's arm suggestion), but Nuna PAUSES to aim the Bola and you are unable to throw the Bola while running. This resulted in me getting chased down by bosses and having to redo tasks over and over again. It's really upsetting I had to give this game a bad review, but it wasn't very fun for me.:(  I liked the characters, the history, and the soundtrack, but game style just wasn't for me. I only played for an hour or so by myself so it might be a completely different experience if you really get into it and if you play with another person. Overall, I give this game a 4/10 based off the first hour of gameplay (half of which was just me falling off platforms due to these glitches).",-1,0

3706372,295790,Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna),"It's a work of art and a cultural embassy, and excellent as both of those.  I found the gameplay itself enjoyable: it's a simple but elegant platformer, sweet and to the point. The environment and characters are stunningly beautiful. The narrative is archetypal, reinforcing the cultural insights the game is designed around.  The two main characters are *adorable*. I'm not often moved by that but you would need a heart of stone not to 'awwww' at the fox.  If you prize long gameplay, a strong challenge and/or adversarial combat -- the game probably will not satisfy you. It is short (I took my time), it is not difficult as platformers go, and the most common enemy is strong wind.  However if you highly prize originality, artistry and/or cultural learning -- you will enjoy and almost certainly cherish this game.  Also, the gameplay is (now?) perfectly functional. Most of the negative reviews in here are from 2014 and talk about disasterious AI malfunctions and control failures. Those would appear to be completely fixed -- I just played the game through single-player, PC keyboard/mouse, and everything worked smoothly for me.",1,0

3708410,296070,MIND Path to Thalamus E.Edition,"Just played through this in one sitting because, for some reason, it just felt like the right thing to do.  HOLY ♥♥♥♥  This game really knocks it out of the park with its design. Those visuals are fantastic. I really hope Carlos Coronado goes on to develop dozens of games.  HOWEVER  I hope he is given very little control over the narrative aspects of his games. It boggles me that someone can have such great taste in design and still give the greenlight to such awful writing and voiceover work to accompany their game. This is some of the worst writing I've experienced in a game. I want you to think about that statement for a moment, think of every ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cutscene you've seen, every dumb plotline. This game still manages to outdo them. How? Because it presents itself as awful poetry, then subverts itself and its plotine with cringeworthy self reflection, then manages to return to the awful plotline and wrap it up in a way that offers no imagination or room for interpretation. You can't scream at your audience 'this is what the story is!' after you've just screamed at them 'aren't these metaphors stupid!?'  It was announced that this game is getting a re-write. Hopefully they fix this but the narrative is so ingrained into its design (which, oddly enough, is actually good design) that I can't imagine a rewrite saving it.  Ugh, how tragically disappointing.  Update: I played a little bit of the new update and, while the narrative still has enough problems to warrant my thumbs down, it is indeed an improvement. In the new version, the voiceover is basically optional. It is clear that the designers weren't confident enough in the VO and writing to force their audience to endure it.",-1,1

They dumbed down ship design and combat, made it boring and pointless (two of the biggest factors that made the previous one's so great).   They implemented a space lanes only model, which I'm not againts space lanes, but they should have done something to allow for other ways to play the game. Look at Stellaris as an example where you choose your FTL method which then determines your method of travel through the galaxy. MoO 1&amp;2 did not even have space lanes either, so not sure why thats the only option in this game.  Graphics are nice overall, a bit on the cartoony side for my tastes, but not something that would prevent me from buying and/or enjoying the game. Voice acting is very good as well.  Strategy seems pretty shallow as well. Just doesn't have that strategic magic or challenge that makes me want to come back over and over again.  Now it seems like they are rapid firing DLC out for the game as well. Not something I will be investing in.

After years with no updates I had forgotten it was even in my Steam library. Imagine my surprise to find that not only are there still no updates, but the game is no longer in early access. What the heck, I'll install it again...  Nope, looks just as bad as it did two years ago. Crashes 3x trying to play the first 30 seconds of the tutorial. So screw it, I'll try the real game - it can't be that hard to figure it out. OK here are some metal plates and rods, I'll make a....shovel? Surely that's the most important thing to craft when stranded on Mars...  I now have a shovel, it's time to do some terraforming! So let's see, I'll click on the dirt? It's not doing anything but I can't stop shoveling....maybe I'll try to equip one of these steel rods instead, I can plant it upright and start building a shelter. Oh wait, all I can do is put it back down just like I found it but look! The crafting menu says I can make a hammer; we all know hammers are necessary!   With my new hammer and trusty shovel I decide that I'll explore my surroundings for a place to build a new home. After a 30 second jaunt around the planet, I return to the wreck of my ship and attempt to use my hammer on it. Apparently this is NOT what you do to survive on Mars as Terraformer immediately stopped working.

3738525,298260,Only If,"Well, there isn't much to say about this game except this, It's a game. This game suffers from a short campaign, disinteresting puzzles, and lack of interest. I genuinely thought that this game wasn't terrible, but it most definitely wasn't good, It had good voice acting, good graphics on any type of preset, and it had believable endings that were satisfactory. This game was very shallow overall and the style and the gameplay made me think this was a knock off version of Soma, which is an excellent game at it's core, but it was not as good as Soma is. Since I am writing a review, I'm going to score this game based on my personal opinion and it's pros and cons, I am giving Only If a 5.5/10(Barely above average) because this game is not a terrible game, this is just one of the games where the cons outweigh the pros in mainly everything about the game. My opinion is that if your like me and want to be engaged in a story that is worthwhile and longlasting, then I don't recommend this game, but If you like a short and sweet brainteaser then this is probably the game for you.

Enjoy the same lame 'meme' faces we've all seen near the end of the game. Game mechanics work fine, but at the end it just feels... lacking. I don't know. Maybe I just don't get it.

Unfortunately upon release I've found the game to be fairly disappointing, I'll list below my reasons that I just can't recommend.  -Poor optimisation for my rig (May be patched) -A fair few crashes (May be patched)  -Sounds don't seem to sync properly with what is causing them -Weapons are not all true to the Warhammer lore -Lack of real feedback upon taking damage can make it incredibly hard to tell you're injured amidst the chaos. (Even with the HP circle) -Poor online connectivity (Could be due to release stress)  In general I just found this game incredibly disappointing. It felt simply lackluster on a lot of making me feel like I was playing a terminator. The sound designed felt a little too light, after all the boltors are essentially miniature rocket launchers, terminator armour weighs an absolute ton too. When jumping off a small height I shouldn't land with a faint 'thwap' and nothing else.  It's just disappointing, I can't overlook the short fallings unfortunately.",-1,0

I want to like it -- I enjoyed Vermintide and I want to see this company succeed, but this game is severely rough around the edges.   The one word I'd use to describe this game is: Clunky. The interface is clunky, slow, and looks like it was some stock UI plugin in Unreal with a chosen font out of some preset options. Others have commented on the bugs. For me, it just does not feel a game worth the clunkiness and rough edges, yet. If they had another 6 months to just go over everything and clean up the UI and fix bugs and add a few more passes to game models, it would have been great. But, alas, the deadline of Christmas meant cut corners.",-1,0

The singleplayer is boring and the multiplayer, which if it was done well could have made this a great L4D-like game, is broken.

You set to one task during the day Monday-Friday, a different task in the evening and then something for Saturday and Sunday. You can't pick what to do each day, so if you finish a costume on a Wednesday, you're stuck 'working' on it the rest of the week. At any rate, I'm still addicted to trying to get all the costumes.

3770788,300060,ADR1FT,"Played on the Vive. Was looking forward to this. Unfortunately..  The idea that you would make a VR game with a fixed POV is an anachronism. While I understand that this was originally designed for a terrible control scheme, no attempts have been made to fix the inherant issues with such a scheme, it's only been mapped to less intuitive controllers. Turning your head does not actually change your POV. If you're lucky you get to see your helmet from another angle, the other options are your head clipping outside of your helmet, or the helmet realigning itself in space seemingly at random.  I would like to hope that the developers at some point in the future will rethink how a person should control their experience in VR. This seems like it could be an interesting experience, heck just give me Mark Watney style wrist propellant and the ability to turn my head and I'm good. As it stands, this might be one of the most depressingly poor experiences in VR, depressing because it feels like there's probably a decent game in there somewhere.",-1,0

Even disregarding that, I can see very little reason to play this game since there is no story to speak of either. Spending 20$ on a VR demo seems extremely excessive to me, especially since most people don't even own a VR headset at this point.

You start the game on the ship, with the characters from Saints Row IV, having a birthday party for Kinzie Kensington. Then Matt Miller bring out some sort of demon-summoning board out to tinker with. All of a sudden, The Boss is kidnapped by Satan to marry Jezebel (Satan's Daughter). Then without thinking about their actions, Johnny Gat and Kinzie Kensington jump into the gateway and find themselves in Hell. After you go to Hell you see the Ultor Building and go towards it to pay Dane a visit. He then gives you the ability of Super Jumping/Flight and Super Sprint. You then go to meet Blackbeard, Shakespeare, Vlad, and the DeWynter twins to receive your four supernatural superpowers (Summon, Stomp, Blast, Aura). You then can start doing loyalty missions for each of your new friends. All of a sudden there is a sceen when Jezebel leaves her room and heads out to hunt for Johnny Gat so she can help him. Then the game kind of cools down after you rescue all of your new friends from Satan's goons. You then do all your missions, challenges, etc. to fill your Satan's attention bar to finally take down the devil himself.",1,0

3828513,3020,Call of Juarez,"Call of Juarez... anxty western with bad hair, nice horse animation and an enjoyable (if forgettable) overall experience. I picked this up in a bundle offer a while ago (I think it came with my copy of Metro 2033) and it sat patiently in my games tab for over six months before i finally decided to give it a try. After having shot through the storyline in a shade over 8 hours, I wound up at the finish line with a slight feeling of disappointment   I mean, it's a nice game overall with some lovely wildlife animations, a clean minimalist HUD, an interesting (if cliche'd) story and a good pace changer with the story and gameplay switching between the two dfferent characters. But despite the overall pleasent experience, there are some crumbs in the bed causing a serious itch.  First, the observant will notice that some loading screens have gross typos and grammatical errors that should have been caught in pre-release by QA.  Second, the PC controls and gameplay reek of a quick and dirty port from console to PC platform, this can lead to some annoying moments of button mashing at times. Additionally, the mouse input during duels feels like my crosshair is mired in treacle.  Third, the gameplay is short... as in you can get through it without trying in under 10 hours with ease and more likely you'll finish it in 6 to 8 hours and little replay factor other than backtracking to pick up Wanted posters that you missed on your first run.  So overall, if it's on offer and you have a day to waste then pick it up, just don't count on it for replay value.  And in closing, what happened to Suzy after the Reverend finished with the saloon???",1,0

Good voice acting, easily controllable battle mechanics, awesome visuals and a pretty decent story. It doesn't really have any replayability other then if you want to do it again on a harder level.

I had to turn off the motion blur, and reduce the mouse sensitivity by a large amount to find the game visually playable. The graphics are very impressive, but with so much constant movement, running, and over the shoulder fighting, it becomes a little unbearable to play. If the took the camera view out just a bit i think it would really make a big difference.",-1,0
3836949,302510,Ryse: Son of Rome,"WARNING:  This game initially started as a real lesson in frustration and irritation due to the engine not using triple buffering, and my not being able to run this game at 60fps and 60hz. With Vsync enabled, it locks you down to 30fps, whether or not you want it.  This caused a massive amount of irritation and frustration until I finally found a fix, 3 hours later. Next came the constant crashing. I managed to fix that the same way farcry 3 was affected by some geforce 660ti users. Then when I finally started playing the game, Here are my thoughts:  #1. The gameplay and controls are horrible. The camera movement and gameplay is weak. Its a basic hack and slash. #2. Constant “combo kills” and other nonsense icons are constantly flashing ingame, making it feel like im playing a tekken game, or some other “fighting” genre game. #3. Oftentimes, it is unclear as to where you are supposed to walk and move. #4. The turret application was weak. #5. During massive fights, centurians just stand there and dont swing at the enemies. #6.Throwing a pilum across an entire stadium is nonsense. Target reticules are huge and unneccessary, takes away from the environment. #7.Beautiful cinematics #8.Decent plot and interesting story. #9. Ghosts and visions take away from a more reality based theme, but overall were ok.  #10.I would have preferred a more realistic atmosphere, as opposed to this heavily sensationalized piece.  #11.The game is visually stunning, and requires a beast of a computer to run beautifully. Probably the best visuals I have seen to date. #12.Anime like uniforms. Turnoff. #13. A top notch soundtrack, one of the best.  #14.Some cheesy comments and dialogue.  To the games credit, it did pick up quite a bit in the later episodes, but due to the above reasons, I am not recommending this title, I think that it is mainly flash, with very little substance, not a bad ride, but one that should be had for a minimal amount of $$$.",-1,0

You just start in the middle of nowhere, beat 6 short stages and beat the final boss without any explanation except that monsters were attacking a Koho village.  The game is extremely easy and the bosses only have one or two attacks that they keep using the same way for the entire fight without any sign of artificial intelligence. The gameplay was also reduced to only a melee attack and a charged ranged attack compared to previous games.   It's like the creator regretted he made the first two games free and rushed a third game just for a bit of money.",-1,1

3854450,303210,The Beginner's Guide,"After coming hot off the heels of The Stanley Parable, I was very excited to try this game out. Unfortunately, it seems that my expectations for the game overhyped me and gave me a very different idea of what this game is really about.  This game is a story. It's not really a game in any traditional sense. It's an aparently true story about the developer of the game and his friend, and the relationship they had, and the games that they made. When I say this isn't really a game, I mean that the only real mechanics of the game are walking around and hitting button promps every now and then. While you do these things, the game's narration plays in the background and adapts to your actions. Some of the 'levels' of the game are actually pretty intresting, and I have to admit, the ending of the game got me. However, this game can be completed in like 2 hours with very little replay value. It's more like a library of levels, or like reading through the letters of two pen pals.  I would recomend this game only if the premise of this game interests you and if it's on sale. I would say this is a better game then other walking simulators like Dear Esther, but not an amazing game overall. I don't regret buying it, but this game is not what I expected and not really advertised well (to be fair it would be very hard to advertise a game like this).

I firmly believe that this game is just an attempt to prod players into asking themselves certain kinds of questions, especially about self-worth. And for what it's worth, it has succeeded at this goal magnificently going by many of the rave reviews and recommendations it has received.  But players who are not prone to navel gazing, who are self-actualized people, are just going to find the game boring and self serving for the creator.

3862218,304050,Trove,"Here is an honest review...  The game itself is great. It's basically what Cube World was suppose to be and more. If you don't know what Cube World was, then let me go ahead and just describe what Trove is instead. In Trove you can go into randomly generated worlds filled with dungeons and a scant few other interesting things. Clear dungeons for loot, mine for ore, fish, etc. The goal is pretty much just to level up and get the best gear, so it's not unlike other MMOs in that sense. The game also features some optional building elements (building a home/etc).   All of that being said, the game suffers from major server issues. Trion, the developers, are notorious for hosting their games on extremely low quality servers and Trove is no exception to this. 'Rubberbanding', or the server lagging to the point that you are instantly reverted to your previous location from a few secions prior, is a common occurance. Waiting for the server to load the land infront of you is not in any way uncommon. The average ping you could expect to be playing is is anywhere from 200 to 1,000. Now 1,000 ping may seem bad, but it's a hell of a lot better then when the servers are down, which is quite often. There is rarely a day that goes by when the servers are not shut down, without any warning might I add, for an hour or two. Pretty much every time the game is updated, majory or just by a hotfix, you should expect the servers to be down anywhere from 2 to 12 hours.",-1,0

3863553,304050,Trove,"Playing this for the first time, it's easy to get sucked in. It's sort of a Minecraft Lite in MMO form, where the main worlds are generated at random but seeded with prefab dungeons with bosses and loot. Deconstructing a piece of equipment lets you add its style to a permanent list, so when your awesome-looking trident is outclassed by a wet fish you can still keep using that trident's skin. You also get a 'cornerstone' of limited horizontal but impressive vertical dimensions in which to build a base/home that you can slap down anywhere an empty lot is present.  Probably the biggest draw of the game is the variety of classes available, all of which have playful spins on existing class tropes and most of which are significantly differentiated and fun to play as. This is important because the core gameplay is really just the trickle-feed of watching your classes gain levels and get shiny new equipment drops as you plunder the same set of dungeons you've been through 30 times apiece already. Unfortunately, on top of the already somewhat ridiculous cash shop prices there's been an announcement that Trion are going to be jacking things up even more and locking the classes behind a paywall (unless you're willing to grind yourself into a fine dust to get class tokens from the player market). It was fun while it lasted, but being told that this is not only going to happen but is also going to be FOR THE BETTER is pretty much EA levels of dickery.

3871947,304050,Trove,"I've been playing Trove since a week into closed beta (So late September 2014). I wasn't too keen in the beginning, the graphics seemed weird to me and it took me a while getting used to the game play in general.  This game has changed so much since then! There's a rather long tutorial line now that shows you the game, the different worlds, so you aren't lost when first starting the game. The combat/adventuring system is really nice with a lot of different classes to choose from. There are a lot of biomes with different monsters and player-created dungeons that change regularly! There's a lot to do in Trove. There isn't a mission or quest line, but you create your own adventure. There are boats, dragons, you can go fishing or fight monsters with various classes. You can customize each class with different styles you can save (there are A LOT of styles), but also different flasks and flask effects (emblems) make your class unique in the way YOU want to play it. Adventuring isn't the only part of the game though. You can build in club worlds with friends or create your own little home in your Cornerstone you can take anywhere with you. There are basically no limiations to your imagination.   Trove is a great game with (so far) weekly updates. Developers working closely with the community on their official forums.

They constantly go back on their word regarding implementing new content. I.e, the recent addition of PvP was supposed to be entirely optional and was NOT supposed to have any exclusive rewards attached to it. A blatant lie.  Used to be entertaining, but went downhill fast. Also very boring with no worthwhile content to stick around for. Each new patch just introduces reskinned meaningless vanity items to your collection.  Whack/10   Edit 1/17/2016:  The forum moderators and devs censored a concern about the direction of the game, and was silently moved from the 'general discussion' to the 'off topic' section because they didn't agree with the tone of it. Then after everyone was openly asking why the thread was moved to off-topic (even though the entire thread pertained to the current state of THE GAME, they then covertly moved it BACK to general discussion and promptly closed the thread, yes CLOSED it, because apparently discussing covert moderator action is 'against forum posting rules'.

'A fun grinding game with pretty good graphics and gameplay' so i tried it myself 'oh ok cool so there are different worlds for different levels', 'Ay! Im lvl 6 now i can equip these epic weapons someone dropped on the floor!'. Then it happened, 'Oh yay another ledgendary weapon...', 'Oh look it's another boss that I've encountered about a million times now...'. At that point the only thing that kept me going was getting wings (when i played you have to be mastery rank 40 to get wings) but when i did get wings i stopped playing for a while. So i come back to the game about 5 months later i see all the cool new stuff like the new dragons and mounts then i realized that there were a butt ton of new classes so i tried to get them all which drove me for a while, until the game became p2w... Now if you wanna get some good stuff in the game you gotta pay with real money?! Might as well make this game $10!! Cause thats how much classes cost! Dont get me wrong it was fun, was. Now I look back at the memories i have with the game. Rushing with my brothers to get the dungeon, getting the occasional matinence, and having a free game that I could actually bond with my brother for a while.

3887230,304650,Sunless Sea,"I will introduce this review by stating that I like Sunless Sea, even though I am not recommending it.  The game itself is merciless, random, unforgiving, depressing, tantalising, fabulous. And SLOW. It is adapted from the browser game 'Fallen London' from which it borrows all of the content, and unfortunately, all the boredom as well. Currently playing my third game, I had to take a break and write this review.  Sunless Sea is unfortunately plagued with bugs and suffers a shoddy gui which kills the game. To survive in this game you need to scrounge every echo, every barrel of oil and every crate of supplies. The game is already hard enough without bugridden software screwing your economics.  In the current game, I had managed to purchase the Townhouse in which I constructed the Monstrous Almanac. After visiting the surface at Naples, I returned to find I no longer had a Townhouse. I did not sell it.  Further, in game 2, which I gave up on by the way, I discovered that the game will not award your 50% quality bonus on legacy. I had raised my Iron from 25 to 62 plus 11 from officers. I selected Iron and lo and behold, no bonus. It should have been a minimum of 43. This is patently fraud. The game provides a clear contract as to how it operates, yet mysteriously, it does not.  With regard to the gui. This made me realise that the game had not properly been user acceptance tested. I don't want to insult or discredit Failbetter, but they could swallow some of their own titular advice.  The disgusting menu popups have a click through phenomena, which means the area on the button you click, if it has a button underneath, then that will be clicked as well.   Now the game HUD where all the action takes place. The single 'feature' which kills the game for me faster than Surprise! It's a Dreadnought, is the Weapon toolbar extension (for want of a better name). Why is it there is the first place? It is completely useless, it takes up 20% of the screen, the logic enabling and disabling it is broken, so you will get the weapon extension but no way of removing it. This will probably kill your character. And from an aesthic viewpoint, it is a revoltingly ugly. I don't know whose idea it was but let's surmise a Noob Programmer, Great Idea #1. Get rid of it, you will be improving the game and removing useless bug ridden code to boot. Then there is the target status overlay another useless dingle that usually shows offscreen, or when it isn't offscreen, it is obscured by the broken weapon tool extension. Simply horrible.  Now we get to the hotkeys. What does ESC do again? Ahh pops up the game menu - the LEAST used command, and it has an icon anyway. What does space do? Pauses/Unpauses the game. Fine. I think the principles of interface design are lost in this game. A ten minute discussion and a test monkey would have cleared all this crap up.  But it didn't happen. And now I am going to sulk about LOSING MY TOWNHOUSE FOR NO REASON. And in the latest game I had explored nearly the entire map without dying.  Fallen London is a quirky, malevolent and sickly inward twisted world product of the designers. And, perhaps, for all I know or CARE, these glitches are masterfully engineeered to push even the most Zeesoned Zailor over the far eastern precipice of madness and disillusionment.  I will give this game a positive review IFF I get back my damn townhouse and you REMOVE the weapons toolbar.  Storylet: Fix the game, unlocked with Test Monkey and Teh Kodez at least 1",-1,0

3916022,306130,The Elder Scrolls Online,"It is a MMO and YES it IS a MMORPG. ITs not Skyrim or Oblivion, though it ressembles a lot. So here is my list why this game is actually great ( especially when itès on sale) 1. IT IS HUGE!!! It is, dont get me wrong, probably bigger then World of Warcraft or at least same sized ( I think its bigger)  2. For a MMO, it has voice audio for all quests FINALLY NO BORING READING. The story line is long to get into and you will do alot of useless stuff but the missions are interesting 3. FOR ALL THOSE who LOVE LORE, this game offers a lot of information about GODS that you will see in Skyrim and Oblivion. This is my actual reason why I choosed the game. You will ( if Ièm not wrong) meet MOlag Bal and hear many stuff about others. + you will se the homeland of elves, Khajits, IMPERIAL!!! and many others. Its really nice if you'r into the LORE  P.S. it is a MMORPG, not skyrim or oblivion or other series.

3920502,306130,The Elder Scrolls Online,"Game feels dated even tho its pretty new. It plays 'Like' a action combat game like tera. But is often really clunky and unresponsive. The class system lets you wear any items any class anyway you want. But realistically, If you want to be a dps caster... use a staff. and use cloth armor.. it just works better.. So it 'Feels' like you can do whatever you want. But realistically to be any good you should play the cookie cutter way.  Population- This game is dieing, and with the release of the new Wow expansion. It might as well have a fork in it. Game is fairly empty. Battleground is HUUGGEEE which would be awesome if thousands of people where playing. But theres only maybe 200 people n the BG area at a time. So its to spread out and never ending.   This game could be amazing with ALOT of more work to it. But in its current state its a failure. And the majority of players know it.

I was excited to try it because I've logged nearly 500 hours into Skyrim, and ESO is often described as 'Skyrim Online'.   The Good:  The game really is beautiful. The character create screen provides a ton of customization options and I enjoyed modifying my high elf exactly how I wanted her. The soundtrack is also great. The gameplay, however...  The Bad: The UI is a mess. No minimap. Action bars only pop up if you are in combat although they can be set to always show. The alt button is used a lot and is a bit clumsy to reach, it feels like Tab would have been a better selection. The character screen 'C' is confusing and not intuitive, I found myself trying to fish around to find what I was looking for. Speaking of , the skills themselves are confusing - why am I leveling class skills and weapon skills and armor skills and somehow it has nothing to do with my level yet is more important...yeah I lost track. For some reason you can immediately get a bounty on your head when you're dropped in Tamriel after the starting experience. I had a restoration staff equipped and cast it at my party member because I was curious if it'd heal him. It hit an NPC, guards were after me, he tried to help, guards were after him...we ended up paying off bounties even though we just started the game. The starting story wasn't very engaging. I didn't feel like I was immersed in Tamriel, and found myself not really caring what NPCs said and blowing through their text to (maybe) get a quest marker. Combat PvE was okay, but nothing special. I could kill stuff without too much difficulty. Combet PvP though, in a duel, was laughable. Again, my party member and I tried dueling each other just to see how that worked. We were both sorcerers who had taken the first point in each class tree. We were unable to damage each other before health regenerated and ended up watching both of our familiars shock each other impotently. Somehow that was the most amusing thing to watch.   I really tried to give this game a fair shake, and really wanted to enjoy it. Unfortunately, I was unable to and do not recommend this title to others.",-1,1

3923147,306550,Runers,"Runers is a top-down, may-as-well-be-twin-stick shooter with roguelike qualities, including permadeath. Contrary to what you might have expected after glancing at the screenshots, the game does  not  feature traditional loot, consumables, equipment or an inventory system, other than what’s required to craft spells. With this in mind, I didn’t expect it to have much depth but was pleasantly surprised to be proven at least partly wrong.  The main attraction here is the magic system that lets you combine a catalyst with one to three runes from eight elements to create 285 different spells. Most results are unique in both animation and effect and generally fall under buff, debuff, direct single-target damage, area of effect, or some combination thereof. Spells can be further upgraded in power by dragging duplicate runes of the same element onto them, which augments their damage, knockback, cooldown, bullet size and speed. Runes, and the catalysts needed to combine them, drop from enemies and destructibles and are presented as a reward option when descending floors.  Spell quick slots are limited, maxing out at six after you’ve beaten a few minibosses, and excess spells must be in one of two storage slots or discarded. Two primary spells can be set to autofire so that they blast toward your cursor each time the cooldowns are up, which really makes casting feel like a twin-stick shooter without actual twin-stick support. Spell quality varies wildly with a few feeling overpowered, many feeling useless, and most falling somewhere in between. Casting does not consume resources and is only limited by cooldowns, so it’s fun to experiment with different builds.  Adventuring begins with choosing a difficulty, a racial passive ability, a class that determines your activatable special ability, and a starter spell (or, in roguelike fashion, just hit “random” and let the game decide these things for you). After this, you’ll be placed in a ten-floor dungeon with a toggleable map overlay that shows which rooms you’ve visited and any items you’ve left behind.  Enemies often feel just as, if not more, powerful than you because they cast the same spells available to you and can quickly fill your debuff bar. Combat involves a lot of running in circles as a result, dodging projectiles like you’re in bullet hell while slinging your own spells toward the pack of enemies that’s chasing you. Emerging as the victor will unlock the exits in that room and let you progress to the next. Rinse and repeat. The bulk of Runers’ depth and imagination went into its magic system and there isn’t much in the way of surprises outside of that. There are really only three room variants in the game: rooms containing a throng of enemies, a boss or miniboss, or a challenge (which is often just another throng of enemies whose conditional defeat rewards you with a perk).  Upon leveling up or completing a challenge room, you get to choose between four perks that are drawn randomly from a huge pool. With a few exceptions, these bonuses are more about augmenting your spells to be as deadly as possible and less about traditional character stat building. Even though death is permanent, a runedex keeps track of all the spell combinations you’ve unlocked thus far and a bestiary does the same for all the enemies you’ve encountered. There are also leaderboards for each difficulty and 30 optional, standalone challenges.  As long as you delve into Runers with an open mind and no expectations of it cleanly fitting into a particular genre—and you’re prepared to deal with the difficulty of projectile hell—you should enjoy the ride.",1,0

3926092,306760,Obduction,"It just pains me to write this...it truly does. I've anticipated this games since I heard of the kickstarter, and immediately became a backer. Sadly though, this game was obviously just not ready for release. I would have happily waited another year to have a better, more playable, more TESTED game.   I figure I have a decent computer. Sure, my build is a few years old, but I bought all new hardware. With an 8 core processor, 8gb RAM, middle of the road Nvidia GPU, Win 8.1 (nobody say a word, windows 10 is the devil), I've not really found a game I couldn't run on close to maximum settings. I don't often play fast paced shoot-em-up games due to excessive violence and I don't really buy new games all that often, but I've played plenty of graphically demanding common titles with no issues at all. This game though... My computer runs it of course. Barely. So disappointing. I'd be happy to play the game in medium settings, but it looks like utter crap. Very blury, distored, and obviously designed and optimized for everything set to 'Epic.' I can run the game in high with a slower FPS, and even the high settings looks blury and not very good at all. Unacceptable. How could you let this happen Cyan? I wish you would have spent another year on QA to get this game right.  I'm now faced with a difficult dilemma, I really would like to play this game, but really don't have it in my budget to go out and upgrade my already decent graphics card and buy an SSD just so I can play this game. Game code should be better optimized to support those with slightly older hardware. I've no need to run every setting to max, but I expect that the visuals still look decent. The issue is they really don't. Whats worse it the stuttering and freezing the occurs, no doubt because this game is constantly fetching disk data in an inefficient format. I don't need an SSD for ANY OTHER game I own, why should I need to go out and buy one for this game? I'm so dissapointed. If it was just me, I'd just tell myself to take a hike and deal with it. Literally, hiking is probably a way better way to spend my time than playing a video game. But I know i'm not the only one. Many have had issues, and it's all due to poor QA. Maybe one day when I've paid off my student loans, my kid is grown, and I've gotten a fat down payment for a house in my savings, I'll finally have the spare funds to blow on new hardware or new PC build, but right now the reality is that people like me who enjoy wholesome quality entertainment video games (without all that blood, gore, violence, and underdressed women that have become the disgusting norm)... we really have lives and families and just don't have the money to go out squandering money on expensive computer hardware thats marked up 60%+ from cost.  I can go buy an SSD for 45$, so maybe I can sell some stuff to get the money for that. So there. I did my part and conceded to doing that. But graphics cards are all over 100$, and most closer to 200$ and even 300$. WAY too much. No, I'd prefer to see a game that handle something in the middle, not tested on the super duper high end side of the spectrum.  I'm not even angry. How can I be? This company made two of my favorite games. And I believe that creative spark is still there. I'm just sad that more time wasn't put into the consideration of customer demograpics and QA that makes us all pleased with our investment. Truly, truly, I would have waited another year Cyan. Others would have too. It would have been worth it. I hope one day I can sit down, play this game and enjoy it, but for now I'll have to let it collect dust on the shelf. *sob*",-1,0

3935604,307780,Mortal Kombat X,"TL:DR I've never had someone take my money and run before, but then i bought Mortal Kombat X for the PC.   I have spent over $1,000 in the last year on Steam. I've also owned multiple Steam accounts since Half-Life 2 was released. In fact, i don't think i've ever tried to refund anything in my life until I bought Mortal Kombat X.  if you're on the fence about it like i was, DO NOT BUY THIS. If it's free by the time you read this review, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS.  The developers legitimately abandoned this game. They only provide new updates, netcode fixes, online moderators, online SUPPORT, and the new Kombat Pack on XBOX ONE and PS4. I found out 5 hours into playing it, which is a shame because it only takes 2 hours to void your refund warrenty on Steam.  When addressed by an unhappy community, the developers deleted all of the threads and posts, and never replied nor commented about it. They simply swept the community's feedback right under the rug, with our money in their pockets.  The developers are seemingly pretending that this game never even existed for the PC platform. It's INSANE...  MKX is a cashgrab and your satisfaction is not a concern to the producers. there's no police force to protect you if you get robbed of your money on Steam. it's a shame... i bet the developers of MKX knew this beforehand, and paid Steam a big chunk of money to sell their tainted ♥♥♥ game (like some sort of illegal narcotic).   companies like this just pitch a couple bucks to Steam and, voila, within 2 hours of playing, the consumer's money is unreturnable. these guys are legitimately worse than stock brokers and loan sharks when it comes to stealing your money, because YOU'RE NOT RECEIVING ANYTHING in return for your money. just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ storyline that ends just in time for your refund to get declined.  if they weren't going to follow through with this game, they should have just released it on a disc in a ♥♥♥♥ing box on a dusty shelf over at Gamestop.

3952899,310110,NS2: Combat,"This game is literally a stand alone version of Faultline Games' mod to Natural Selection 2. If you like Natural Selection 2 and enjoy playing it then you will enjoy this game.  If you have not played Natural Selection 2 then do not buy this game until the developers add a demo of some sort. This is a multiplayer game akin to Team Fortress or tribes, there is no single player content aside from playing against extremely rudimentary bots.  This game is built on the premise of being a competitive asymmetrical pvp game that is fought between two factions: Marines and aliens called the Khara. Marines are similar to playing an older FPS with contemporary mechanics. The Khara are similar to playing a handful of different games.  There is a player leveling system based on experience points gained in game. There is a character progression system in play sessions that levels up the player character to unlock things in the game. On the Marine side this in-session leveling system is used to unlock guns and exosuits. On the Khara side this system is used to unlock abilities and new classes.  A general description of the game paints it as intruiging, which is true: the concept is interesting. The execution is where most of the game's shortcoming come from. There isn't enough to differentiate this game from Natural Selection 2, but instead it feels like the in-session progression system is a half-baked mechanic.  This game's success is dependent on it being different enough from Natural Selection 2 to draw players away from it, and yet it is not. It is so similar to Natural Selection 2's mod called Combat that many players who like the series are staying there or boycotting this game.  On average there are 30 players playing this game, and those are mostly the holdouts who want the game to succeed. On Octorber 30th the game had a large spike in players going up to 116, then increasing to 128 players by Nov 1st. However, these numbers droped to 56 by Nov 4th, and have more or less been on a slow and steady decline. It appears that new players join the game and then quit shortly after. This should tell you the kind of game you are getting here. If new players are joining and then quitting within a week then there are massive problems with the game itself.  This game's biggest problem is that it does nothing to retain new players. The players who are already playing and have hundreds of hours in the game and love it will continue playing—they are the holdouts—but new players will play for a week or so and then quit to play something more accessable. New players are pitted against experienced players and there are no mechanics to help new players win. There are no first optimal strategies that have low skill and reward ceilings such as CoD's noob-tube, Street Fighter's thousand hand slap, or Unreal Tournament 99's rocket launcher.  New players are thrown into a meat grinder, and they quickly decide they do not want to play this game. People who are enjoying it will tell them that it takes 50 - 200 hours to properly enjoy the game, but the problem is that there is nothing to ease new players into enjoying the game. No lower skill strategies that evolve into higher skill strategies whereby noobs become pros.  The other primary problem with this game is the community. The developers will ban people from the forums for 'trolling' and then cite their rules instead of actually trying to find out what is wrong and why the player feels negatively about the game. The community itself can be extremely toxic, and that just leads into negativity going all around.  If you live in the E.U. you can more or less try this game without risk since you can return it after playing it if you do not enjoy it. If you live outside the E.U. where that law does not apply then buy at your own risk.  If you speak negatively about this game the developers will, instead of working towards making their product better, pursue you onto whatever social media they can find that you use and harass you there. True professionals, though it is good for a laugh from time to time.  This will tell you how many people are playing the game before you buy it.    http://steamcharts.com/app/310110   I regret this purchase. A great many other people also regret buying this. Many of the posititve reviews are either from developers or people who absolutely loved the mod before it became a standalone. The negative reviews come from people who are not pros at Natural Selection 2.",-1,0
3953394,310360,Higurashi When They Cry Hou - Ch.1 Onikakushi,"Higurashi is a 'sound novel'. It doesn't have choices, the art pretty much does its job pretty well, and the music and sound effects are used to convey the emotions in a scene. The start of the novel is very slow. It took me 6 hours to get to the part where the plot really kicked in. Despite the slow start, the beginning is pretty fun. It's a nice lighthearted comedy slice-of-life until the horror and mystery elements really creeps in. When it does, it's pretty difficult to stop reading. It's very good. At first, this looks far from a horror game but the psychological horror is done well. It's genuinely scary and even though I don't like horror that much, I loved this visual novel.  Highly recommended if you can tolerate the slow start.",1,0

3963926,310470,Grand Ages: Medieval,Looks great. After having played it now for several hours its basically a trading game. I like medival total war and games that include combat. Although this game has warfare it is of little use. Even huge battles settle nothing and taking over a town is far simpler diplomatically as you can basically buy independent towns once you have their favour. There are much better games out there.,-1,0

3964418,310510,Deathtrap,"Deathtrap is one of those games that is good but not quite great. While being a decent game in its own right you can't help but think that what it really constitutes is the potential foundation for something better and more polished. Maybe a sequel that improves on the formula in the event that this debut entry is supported enough to warrant one.  Just to get it out of the way I'll say straight up that I haven't experienced any technical issues with regards to the game not running, crashing, etc. I know that in the past others had complained about what sounded like really specific issues resulting in the game not running properly on their system. That hasn't been the case with me and at this point I've only encountered one very minor bug (twice).  Characters in Deathtrap control nicely, and by 'nicely' I mean 'exactly how you'd expected them to given that they represent the action rpg component of the game as advertised'. Character specs are meaningful and interesting but not entirely pivotal which is probably as it should be.  The game's traps are pretty cool for the most part. Some are classics (spike floors, lava tiles, lightning towers, etc.) whereas others are a little more offbeat and serve to keep the tower defense aspect of the game fairly fresh. Traps have upgrades that must be spec'd into to utilize in combat and I think this is where Deathtrap really shines. The traps work like you'd expect them to and are devastatingly effective. Even while defending multiple chokepoints solo you won't feel like your arm is being twisted by artificial difficulty in an attempt to force you into multiplayer. The game gets harder, yes, but only as it ramps up naturally while your character and traps simultaneously gain strength. This alone makes Deathtrap worthy of attention in a development culture rife with micro-transactions fueled by nearly enforced group play. I paid a reasonable one time cover charge for the game and I'm having fun playing it. What more could an avid gamer ask for?  In the end I'm glad I supported this game and I hope others do too. I'll be looking forward to seeing where they go with it in the future. ",1,0
3964890,310510,Deathtrap,"This game is annoying. Annoying because I love RPG's, and I love Tower Defense games, but it's just too unpolished still which makes playing it (especially with a gamepad) a frustrating experience. Some of the issues that need to be addressed:    The controller experience is absolutely terrible, especially when navigating various UI screens. The icon that tells you what to press is too small, doesn't stand out enough, and is never in a consistent location which means you end up hunting to find the button that you're meant to press.    The UI in general is pretty bad, with dialogs and detail popups frequently covering other controls or even in some instances important things like tower range rings.    There's no way to exit back to the map, so you have to force quit the game if you accidentally select the wrong level.  Seriously, it's so bad that it should basically be redesigned from the ground up... if any UI design conventions were followed, they were all the wrong ones. Neocore, do yourselves a favour and hire a User Experience Designer (or if you've already got one, a new one that actually knows what they're doing / doesn't drink heavily on the job).",-1,1

There is no arcade mode available at this point of time, disconnects are pretty frequent for some reason and people can intentionally DC to keep their winstreaks(WTF, Crapcom?).

3975884,310950,Street Fighter V,"As a die heart fan of SF series since SSF4AE, I have to firstly admit the V-system of SFV has the potential to make it a great FTG and surpass its predecessors. But, after playing a couple of rounds with my friend I felt awfully annoyed and even angry with this painful 'direct input' of keyboard (yes as a FTG fan I don't know how to play with a joy stick or gamepad). And I decide to give it a 'Not Recemmend' for this reason. I mean, Capcom should have done better at such details. I'm devoted willing to explore this brand new system and gameplay if it's not the hinder of input. However, Capcom just kills passion. I will come back and give 10 'Recommend's once the input issue has been solved. Before that, let's just watch. PS. the invitation feature is totally incompatible with steam's friend system. The dev team should learn from USF4 on this. PS2. the Unreal 4 Engine has done nothing amazing but dropping the frames",-1,1
3976081,310950,Street Fighter V,"I don't want to have to not recommend this game but in it's current state, unless you really love fighting games, it's really not even close to worth full price.  Pros: -One of the most solid fighting games in terms of mechanics on the market. It's a bit of a departure from 4 but depending on what you want from the game that can be a good or a bad thing. -Decent character roster. With the exception of F.A.N.G. who seems to have a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ moveset (demonstrated by the fact that in 6 hours I have not fought one single person using him online) the rest of the characters old and new are fun and varied. -The optimisation on my PC at least seems excellent. The game can hold 60fps with no noticable dips with all settings maxed on my i5 and GTX670. -Being able to unlock future characters which would otherwise be DLC through in game currency.  Cons: -Fight Money is not called Bison Dollars. -There is no store currently available for me to spend my 200,000 Fight Moneys in. -The story modes available for each character are frankly pathetic. When it was anounced to be a mode comparable to MK9/10's story modes which were a good few hours long each with nice in-engine cutscenes and all the fancy trimmings I got excited. What you actually get when you begin a 'Story' is a well drawn still image for a minute or so while one of the voice actors says a few lines, then another still image for another minute or two with some more lines, then another, repeat ad nauseum for every single 'cutscene' for every character. I got bored after the first two and just skipped them all for every single character which left me with 2-3 fights for each character taking me a total of 48 minutes to complete the story mode. Before you say that doesn't count because I skipped cutscenes, I say a collection of 30 still images is not what was advertised. -The netcode while better, is still not great. Even having restricted my search options to only the most compatible connections available I still get matches with opponents teleporting around me, random slowdown mid-match and depending on the time of day wait times up to several minutes to even find a game. -The servers flat out were not working on launch. This is unacceptable for a AAA game and even though it is the norm it leaves a bitter taste.  -PC version is not compatible with any PS3/4/non-xbox sticks. This was a huge disappointment when I plugged in my Qanba Q1 and it simply didn't function. There are programs you can use to fix it such as x360ce but with probably the biggest and most historic fighting game franchise in the world you simply shouldn't have to! -The game is generally lacking in other game modes. While to my knowledge SF games generally have at least a few different options for minigames and different things to do, in SFV there is no challenge mode, no minigames, you are limited to versus, story and a 30 match endurance/time attack mode.  Basically the whole game feels like they put time into the actual fighting, but everything else is pretty terrible and feels very cheap.",-1,0

3991046,311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"I played this during the free weekend in December, and I have to say, this is the worst COD game I have ever played. To start it all off, the game is $60 and there's a $50 season pass, and on top of that, there's microtransactions. Yes, they are mostly cosmetic but in a game that prides itself on making its players purchase ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of DLC, there are microtransactions to buy more items. Some things can only be gained from microtransactions like taunts. This might be acceptable if the game was good though, right?  The problem is. the game is awful. On a 750 Ti I cannot run with medium textures without terrible performance even when I lock myself to 45 FPS. And, at this graphics level, the game looks to be the equivalent of an Xbox 360 in graphics, I kid you not. There are now winning animations too but the character's animations are absolutely dreadful to look at and the person speaking doesn't even move their lips. How lazy can you get Treyarch?   The combat is also not fun. The one perk's special weapon that I used was horrendus and was actually worse than my normal gun, so why would I ever use it? Not only was that an issue, but the jumping added to the game adds nothing to the gameplay. On every map that I played, the upper map limits were so low that you couldn't even go on rooftops, the only use that I found for the jumping was occassional wall riding, which only made the kills harder to pull off. The gunplay was pretty standard for a COD game, expect for the obnoxiously loud hitmarker sounds.   In conclusion, would I recommend this game? Hell no. If you like COD, which I somewhat do, it's still probably not worth picking up. I hate to say it, but Call of Duty Ghosts is a better game, and its only $7 from some websites. If you want high jumping, go buy WaW and use mods.  TLDR; Avoid this game no matter how cheap it is, it is very flawed.",-1,0

But the Devs need to step there game up and other devolopers need to get rid off Day 1 issues. It makes no sense that these games are made on PC but the coding and FPS drop below normal. They did the beta with justice but the final copy is bad and I mean really bad. If your not running a super computer this game is going to steal CPU memory.

FPS was at a constant 60 on my mid-range PC on highest settings.   From what I gathered in the little amount of time I've played is that Zombies seems to be pretty fun. I didn't play it much, but the new story and gameplay was pretty interesting.   I only played one multiplayer game, but I had a lot of fun. Pretty nostalgic feeling of Black Ops 2.

Multiplayer is the worst i've ever played. Small maps which appear to have been designed to rob the player of the chance to plan and use tactics other than run fast and shoot first. Very few maps, no doubt players will have to buy more to get any replayability from this purchase. Running system stolen from Titanfall. An endless force feeding of micro transaction options. Which moron decided to make zombies an objective based game rather than out right survival? That person should look for another job. Oh and no one wants to have to sit through the storyline intro for zombies every damn time, skipping it halfway through actually makes it even more annoying, we should only have to suffer it once. Player models are fairly nice but drop the 'explosion in a paint shop' costumes. Graphically....not bad..... runs a little slow even on a decent machine but looks pleasant enough. Will I be buying any DLC or weapons......not a chance. Will I be playing this in a month...no I severly doubt it. Do I recommend it.....I recommend you ran as fast as you can away from this title.

4003830,311340,METAL GEAR SOLID V: GROUND ZEROES,"'You've already seen the 'Overwhelmingly Positive' user reviews, haven't you? Why are you here, then? Why do you continue to scroll through them while your memory betrays you? You enjoy reading reviews, that's why.'  I'll get straight to the point. This review's main goal is to address common misconceptions.  Amount of Content: Ground Zeroes offers 7 missions: one main story, four side missions with different objectives, two extra side missions that are aimed at the fans of the series. Each mission has two difficulty settings (hard unlocks after beating normal), secret collectibles/objectives and unlockable trials (challenges). Throughout all missions you'll be dealing with only one location: Camp Omega, which is a fairly large facility. Each mission has it's own time of day. If you like playing your games at a medium pace and you never had contact with this game before then you'll be able to complete all 7 missions in 5-10 hours+. If you're willing to spend time to get 100% completion, get most of the rewards and read/listen to the story then you might end up with 15-20 hours+ on you. However, it's possible to speedrun all 7 mission in ~1 hour (that is, if you know what you're doing). If you buy Phantom Pain alone then you won't be able to access Camp Omega and it's missions through it as they're avilable only for those that purchased Ground Zeroes (meaning this is a prologue and not a demo). However, if you purchased both then you'll be able to visit Camp Omega with all your Phantom Pain upgrades, not to mention special bonuses.  Performance &amp; Settings: Runs on systems that are below minimum system requirements. Well optimized, but could've had even higher level of detail / drawing distance settings (some visible popup of small items). One common complaint are increased amounts of depth of field (blur / out of focus). It's easily 'fixed' by decreasing Screen Filtering to High. Fully playable on K&amp;M but could've had a slightly better control scheme (currently there's some sensitivty bug when aiming while zoomed). Minority of people experiences some compatibility issues some of which were caused by bad system configurations, but some are legit and there most likely will be a compatibility fixing patch.   Metal Gear is a legendary franchise, Ground Zeroes gives you a tiny bite of Phantom Pain and from here it only gets better. If you're into stealth, 'tactical espionage action', shooters or just good stories then you should certainly get it. The game gives you freedom to choose your own path and your own tactics / playing style, be it complete stealth no kill or running around shooting rockets and riding tanks.",1,1

This is a great demo of the upcoming MGS V game. Well it is a bit more than your average demo in that there is a lot of replayability. Also, I have to admit it is a damn good demo in showcasing the mechanical depth and fantastic level design that is come to be expected from MGS games. It does incorporate a save transfer feature where a few things you do in this game will carry over to TPP, like the mass effect series does. It's a shame it doesn't show off more of the gadgets and mechanics we will be using in the TPP, though what is there is great enough. Oh and the pc port is actually really good. It is optimized well and runs a stable framerate (at 60 on my near high-end rig). The only annoyances I have is that the main menus don't have mouse support.  That said I wouldn't really recommend this game to anyone who isn't already a fan of MGS. Like if you have never played a MGS game then this game probably won't do it for you because it is basically just a mission sandbox on the same map. It is a game that is pretty much a test product to gauge fan reactions for the upcoming TPP game, just Konami actually decided to charge for it... If you are one of those people who haven't played a MGS game and still want a taste of what TPP might be like then I would get this when it is like 5 dollars or something.",1,0

4014800,311700,,"The good: Game idea : very similar to Magic: The Gathering (TM), so if it's your type of game, you will enjoy it Game engine : a bit simplistic, not much in terms of elements (controllable and automatic) and sometime buggy in PvP, but easy to understand and easy to understand the gameplay The bad: In-game purchasing : while this game is advertised as 'free-to-play', the portion that you can 'play freely' is small... if you hope to advance much farther than a couple of steps into the game, you requires the real-money purchase of cards or a very large amount of tedious and repetitive game-playing to get resources to acquire more cards... the dependency of in-game purchasing is so great that, after 117 minutes of gameplay (as calculated by Steam), i realized that i cannot progress any further without either spending real money or commit to a hundred or so game-hours to advance one more step... and so i have decided to abandon this game as a result Summary: While the idea is good (similar to a well-known and well-established CCG already in existance), the fact that you cannot play the whole game (or even more than a little bit of the game) without spending money makes this game undesirable Rating: Thumbs down.",-1,0
4015128,311730,Dead or Alive 5 Last Round,"After ~60 hours with the PS4 version of this game, and ~2 hours with this version (Core Fighters), I can safely say that DOA5:LR Steam is almost the same game as its 'next gen' counterpart.   First off, at its core, the gameplay is the same. You get the same fast, fluid, fun fighting action as you would in any version of this game; it's 100% intact (which should be the main priority for any fighting game). A few characters seem a little easier to win with than others (esp. DLC characters) but that's to be expected of any modern fighting game. However if you're playing the Core Fighters version (like me!), Kasumi &amp; Hayabusa are more than good enough to get your feet wet online. Secondly, having previously played the full version of this game and just now playing the Core Fighters version, I have to say that for a F2P title Core Fighters gives the player a lot to do from the start. Except for Story Mode, you can play every game mode with the 4 free characters given to you: Kasumi, Hayabusa, Ayane &amp;  Ein  Hayate. That's Arcade Mode, Time Attack, Survival, Versus, Tutorial, Combo Challenge &amp; Ranked Match. You can still earn costumes and titles for all 4 starting characters by playing these modes, too. To some, this isn't going to seem like a lot of content, but for others, everything you get in the F2P version is what you'd expect from a fighting game in 2016.  I've seen a lot of people complaining about this port, and the main issues seem to be:  1) Lack of online lobbies 2) Arcade port graphics I'll admit that not having online lobbies to play in with friends is a bit of a let-down, but most of my time with every version of DOA5 has been spent in Ranked Match anyways, so I can't really weigh in on that one. As for the 'downgraded' (although not really because DOA5LR is technically still just a port of X360/PS3 DOA5) graphics...I can honestly say they don't matter all that much. You  can  increase the resolution and the quality of shadows to make up for this issue, but the games art direction and overall look are almost identical to every other version of this game. As for other issues, I tried playing with Keyboard, 360 controller &amp; DS4 controller and had no issues with any of them besides having to remap a few buttons. Achievements are fully implemented and working. Netcode is alright, but can take around 1-5 minutes to find a match. DLC is really overpriced, but of course you're not expected to buy all of it (also besides characters it's all just cosmetic fluff anyway).  To finish up, I'd say that if you want all of DOA5:LRs characters &amp; story mode, wait for the 'Full Game' DLC pack to go on sale. Don't judge this port based on launch/early reviews; the game works and is both stable and good looking enough to play. If you just want a few characters to get stuck in with Tutorial, Arcade Mode or Ranked Match, definitely download Core Fighters and give it a chance.",1,0

4016068,311730,Dead or Alive 5 Last Round,"I only brought this game because i like fighting against other real players (so until the online is ready i'll just invite people over)  PROs:  good solid fighter  adictive when played against other players  I've always loved the interactive/breakable environments  soooo much bewbs and a$$ (I have yet to play a male charater lol)  CONs:  masher friendly  DLC is 2x more than the cost of the game (what tha fuq?)  no soft engine: yes i know some say it's not a big deal, but come on this is PC we're talking about here. you could dish 3 to 4x more graphical punishment on a PC than a console, so what gives?  high spec for a game that is missing a complete physics engine (soft engine). call of duty and battlefield 4 are heavier games than this with way more sh!t happening on screen, yet somehow this games specs are in that arena?(team ninja's lack of PC experience is showing)  missing the two extra stages: this one makes no damn sense. left me scraching my head.  CONCLUSION: the pros listed above are enough to make me happy with this game for a time, but the fact still remains: I paid the same price for less game (missing engine and stages and delayed online mode, although i'm not so upset about the online part though) and to add insult to injury tecmo's yosuke hayashi said: 'We would like to ask PC users to play our game in good and moral manner. Otherwise, we won't be able to release a title for PC again.' (i bet they fear that it would cut into their DLC sales). so lets get this straight: missing physics engine, missing stages, no steam cloud or achivements, and expensive DLCs and you feal like people should not mod this game? tecmo, you have guaranteed that this game will be modded, I hope it gets this living fuq modded out of it just to spite you (can't wait).  if this is how tecmo plans to port it's other games to PC then i hope yosuke hayashi keeps good on his threat for this to be the last port. they have proven they know little about the PC platform and it's gamers, and even less about public relations with those gamers. I'll still recommend this game however, tecmo has some issues they need to work through as a company when it comes to PC I sure hope namco doesn't pull this crap with tekken 7.",1,0
4016542,311730,Dead or Alive 5 Last Round,"$600 of DLC. Need I say more? This game literally has 67 pieces of cosmetic DLC, except it's impossible to know what you're actually buying because instead of splitting them into 67 purchases like they did on console, they bundled most of them into packs of $50 or more. Unless you spend a lot of time researching what each one is. It's very clear that Koei Tecmo has no idea what the ♥♥♥♥ they're doing, which is very interesting considering this is NOT their first PC release. This is totally legitimate torrent material, this $500 of DLC.  The game itself was a ♥♥♥♥ing mess forever and I'm not sure the online functionality has yet been implemented. Achievements took them months and again I'm in the beta so I don't even know what's live.  The game itself is dandy, excluding how they gimped the pc version to not use features even the PS3 version had. It's just a shame Team Ninja's first game on PC was such a ♥♥♥♥up, because I had high hopes to be playing Ninja Gaiden at ultra graphics one day if this was successful. One thing I will say is, I am very much not a DOA follower, but I'm curious about a weird similarity to the end of DOA4 in this game.",1,0

But by the end of Area 3, it switches from a well-planned out level design to borderline unfair with more than half of the game to complete. It seems like the game becomes patternless (after spending about 20+ levels where you could find a pattern) just to satisfy a desire to be hardcore. Note to developer: Having a pattern in a platformer doesn't make you less hardcore, it makes you a good developer.  Perhaps if a few things get cleaned up I'll feel different about it.",-1,0
4017765,312050,Red Johnson's Chronicles - 1+2 - Steam Special Edition,"I really wanted to like this game but I just couldn't play it. The controls are horrible. Its a point and click game without the pointing and clicking because they force you to use keyboard controls for things that could easily, and much more fluently, be done with the mouse. At many points the mouse just did not work which seemed to be because i had the mouse at the wrong point on the screen. However since I didn't have a mouse pointer present at the time it was impossible to tell this.   There is also a very limited option screen which only features volume controls. There are no resolution or graphic options at all so you have to play on the settings they give you.   However if you can deal with these issues the game does have some redeeming factors. Although I didn't play long enough to see much of it the story did look to be interesting. The characters were designed very well and had great voices work. But the best factor about this game was the graphics style. The settings all looked amazing with vibrant colours.   Overall if you can overlook the horrible controls and other issues then you could play this game, if it was even just for the story. However I can't recommend this due to it being impossible to play for me personally.   TheIronicGamers rating system",-1,0

These graphics include for example all unit information screens, shown when you move the mouse cursor over a unit or ctrl-click on a unit, some icons as well as all menue graphics and campaign description background graphics.  Another flaw is the haze visible when using a zoomed out view. The bad thing is it can't be disabled and makes it difficult to see everything clear and besides that just lets the world look crappy. The screenshots shown on steam do not show how crappy it looks in reality if you for example use a resolution of 1920x1080.",-1,1

4022796,312530,Duck Game,"Be wary of this game and take the hype with a big spoon of salt. Here's a list of things I had to dig through, MINUTES into the game.  ------------------------------------------------------------  1. Can't use the mouse in any capacity to aim or control (not even the buttons).  2. Controls for the keyboard is absolutely horrid. Fire with V, pick up with C, steer with WASD... What? Even when rebinding them (which many keys still don't work with) It ends up feeling like an incredibly clunky mess that's designed for console controllers and nothing else.  3. Only game so far that has managed to kill both my audio drivers (and ears) twice within a few minutes as the volume is literally 600% above the max at default. At 1% of volume in the mixer, people through Mumble could still hear the game louder than me talking.  4. An indie game that's not meant to be played on the PC is only 23% off during the Summer sales. I mean, really?  5. Random multiplayer lag &amp; Lack of players. For a twitchy (essentially) multiplayer-only arcane shooter like this, even the tiniest amount of lag ends up absolutely killing the experience for me and when combined with the fact that there can be as little as 200-300 people playing this game at once on Steam, I can't help that the situation I found myself in with 2-3 failed attempts to find a multiplayer lobby will only grow worse overtime as there's also little to no replayability offered in this whacky but otherwise stale indie game.  ------------------------------------------------------------  Worst part of this game though, is the community. Any and all negative reviews are bombarded with 'Not Helpful' votes and nowhere does this fanboy display of butthurt get more obvious than the lack of comments left by the people mindlessly spamming said votes. Proof of this can be found right below.  You have been warned.",-1,1

This game (the DS version) is a lot more difficult than even the original japanese version ! You have to use spells you rarely had to use, like slow, haste and reflect even for some normal encounters. Other than that, FF4 is the first game in the series to have a very good narrative, with memorable characters and events, as opposed to the previous 'Light warriors vs. evil emperor' stories. The music is also very good as usual, particularly the battle themes. The only downside are the pixelated 3d models, as this game was originally for the DS.

4027667,312780,Way of the Samurai 4,"Way of the Samurai on the Ps2 was one of my most favorite games of all time that I happen to forget. Imagine my surprise when this came on steam.  Honestly it's a great game despite underneath some technical limitations. It's not the best looking game but it makes up for it in wonderous fun and freedom. You do kind of just what you want, it's an open world that's not padded out with simple collectibles or waypoints for you to find (well there's stuff to collect too). A lot of what you do inadvertently affects the game, open a language school and be able to talk to foreigners, wander around randomly killing people and eventually the crime rate goes down which in turns can affect other aspects of the game.   This isn't a long game but it's meant to be replayable over and over. I think it's something more games should consider doing, where your past decision actually affects dialog and missions and the routes you can take.   tl;dr: Not the best looking game but underneath it all lies a kind of fun and genius that I wished was explored more in bigger budget titles. But seeing how niche this game is though....:",1,0
4027811,312780,Way of the Samurai 4,"Interesting characters (and by interesting characters I mean the three British ones and them alone) and setting (especially one that's often not seen) cannot save this game from the horrible combat mechanics (you're SOL if your swords break, and break they do rather quickly, even the more top tier ones) and frustrating pace. You'd think that you were purchasing the chance to go back in time, so to speak, and change Japanese history on the cusp of the Meiji Restoration, but yet you'll be wishing you could go back in time to change your mind about purchasing this game. Apparently I finished the game without even realizing that I had and to top it off the port, as other reviewers have said, is pretty shoddy.   How do you make this period of history so boring? Why do we need to grind like we're playing some MMO? Did Michel Therrien design this game? Grind, grind and more grind. You are offered the choice to aid one of three factions - the British, Shogunate or xenophobes - or you could even go your own way, but the game is just so dull and frustrating that you'll never experience any of their storylines. Apparently I finished the game via the independent route without even realizing it. All of a sudden the game just told me that my samurai had become a legend within a highly touted Shogunate militia and left me wondering how I got to that point. What I did experience was just rather dull. Honestly, once the novelty of the loli ambassador wore off, I sort of just went through the motions. Nothing gripped me. I had no connection to the characters, and in an era of Japanese history (world history even) as rich as this, that's just a shameful display.  The game's description says you can alter the course of Japan's history, but you never feel like you are at any point. I spent more time getting frustrated with how the grind was so unbearable - for example, there is a very short time to grab Dojima's sword at the hospital battle (yep - those special weapons are for a limited time only and you'll spend most of that time trying to pick up the damn things!) and I ended up focusing on that rather than how I was bringing modern medicine to feudal Japan.  But of course, you'll never get through any of the storylines if you have a keyboard. Don't even bother playing this game with your keyboards. You NEED a controller for this one. The keyboard controls are horrid and the mouse support is barely there. You need to use the keyboard with its crummy control scheme to even do something as simple as navigate the menus. Seriously?  All this game does is make you wish SEGA would port their Yakuza spinoffs - Kenzan and Ishin (which is set in the same period as this game) - to Steam and play those instead.

Your travels will lead you to many different alien planets, aswell as familiar locations on Earth and on the Moon, which makes the game not fully free roam, but consists more of larger hub areas where you can spend time on collecting stuff and do side missions in order to unlock new characters and vehicles. Once you unlock characters, there are no brakes, as you can collect over 150 of them, and all of them have something unique about them, like different cursors and attack animations, which makes them all seem like different characters.   The gameplay is as usual, collect stuff, battle enemies and solve puzzles. This time you will also do some fun and arcade like space combat with power ups like Ikaruga and such, which makes a nice change of pace sometimes. Dialogue was something I was a bit iffy about when I heard that they would be included in all future Lego games, but all of the instances so far has made me laugh and like the charm of it, as the humor is not too childish and varied which makes the games story accesable for all ages, young to old.  The game though has some bugs, which forced me to restart a level one time, and the game crashed once too, but they aren't too distracting in the grand experience. The season pass I bought the game with (Premium edition) Didn't take effect until the friday (14th november) So I guess it was something wrong at the end of Steam, but I got it eventually so no major harm done.",1,0

4064752,314070,Super Mega Baseball: Extra Innings,"It's a fun game with a lot of merits, but some flaws really annoyed me to the point of asking a refund: - Every pitcher has the same repertoire (EVERY PITCHER can throw a screwball! There's no sinker or knuckleball, though). - No way to control lead off for baserunners - No way to pick off baserunners (but there is base stealing) - No multi-season mode  These issues alone lost me.  The lack of advanced stats, even though I'm a stats nut, doesn't bother me because in non-simulation baseball games (that being everything but OotPB) the stats are never consistent for the player-controled team (the characters will end up reflecting the player's skills and struggles, and I don't think there is any way to avoid it without removing the fun of the game).   Too bad I haven't a Playstation for The Show and don't plan to buy one until more games are released (and hopefuly its price drops), so I really wanted to like this game. I really hope the developers make a follow-up game that solves the issues I pointed, because, otherwise, the mechanics are really fine-tuned.",-1,1

4066714,314200,Bionic Heart,"I really dislike the dialogue and character interactions. Unfortunately, that is 90% of the content in a visual novel, so I unenjoyed this Visual Novel pretty thoroughly. I also find the protagonist to be creepy, and some of the things that he says are just perverted, perfidious and unloyal (he is engaged), or out-of-character, and it made me uncomfortable to play as him.  The protagonist's best friend (Tom) seems to have the worst lines out of anyone. At one point Tom says 'With whom you were speaking?', and all of his lines felt very unnatural. The protagonist also seems to only be tolerating Tom, so it doesn't make sense how this person is still the protagonist's best friend.  SPOILERS below!!!!!  In the first five minutes of the game you are given a choice; Let a threatening female android into your home, or call the police. If you call the police, the game gives you a 'bad end' and you are told that the android 'might have been your perfect partner.' It then goes on to say that you live on with your Fiance, have kids, and basically live happily ever after. Which doesn't sound so bad to me, tbh.  The alternative choice is to let her in. In this Visual Novel the protagonist isn't really a 'blank slate' for the player to fill in, he has his own personality and life. This is important to note, because letting in the female android doesn't fit his character. Once she comes in, he sees that she is an android missing half of her face, and then she runs off to hide somewhere in his apartment. Here's the weird part: The protagonist then tells Tom (who was in the other room) that he is sleepy so Tom will leave and the protagonist can be alone with this android. Why in the world would he do that!? This android was just threatening to break down his door, and she's missing half of her face! Being alone with that android is the last thing that anyone would choose to do!  Those are just a couple of examples of character interaction and choices that I found inappropriate. Also, the protagonist creeps me out! He's been engaged to a woman for 10 years, yet just about as soon as this android forces her way into his apartment, he's inner-monologuing about wanting to sleep with her. Even though she is still an immediate threat to him, and is openly threatening to kill him!  I can not recommend this game, to anyone.",-1,1

4068193,314280,The Forgotten Ones,"Great atmosphere, love the RE-esque feel to shifting rooms, but loads of annoyances. The enemies (Or at least the one type I've encountered thusfar) move too fast for iron sights to ever really be of any use, running away isn't an option because of their speed, and once you get hit you're locked into melee with them because you're stuck walking for a few seconds (Which I feel is realistic, but unfair given the fact that they're going to be ontop of you in a second flat anyways). Picking up ammo seemed cool at first, until there were props around the ammo, which you usually accidently pick up instead and send the ammunition flying across the room. Also, I made the horrid mistake of using the pistol to save my precious rifle ammunition, which, it turns out, is just as effective as if I decided to huck rocks at starving cheetahs.",-1,0

4068990,314380,Lantern Forge,"GAME IS ABANDONED &amp; FULL OF BUGS!!!!! A half completed game by another unscrupolous developer.  Game will crash, not load at times and lags. This game is also incomplete and has been inactive for 2 years atleast. One dev appeared a year ago, asked some questions and was never seen again.  Once a game locks up, typically it'll keep doing it and your charactr will become unplayable. I've had 6, only 1 made it to level 50 (max level). The rest were around level 25 (had to delete them, unplayable). The other problem is when the game locks up, you lose a certain about of time. So you go back in, thinking it'll work again, and then it locks up again and so forth.  Initially I gave this game a good review, I've revised it since. This game went too soon out of Early Access (so it could be abandoned).  There are only 2 ways to get exps, fighting and certain crafting.  Each new game starts with a random map. And not all maps are equal. My first game, I spent hours digging to only find a few scraps of ore. And the ability to make stairs didn't even appear until my character was 16th level (game bug). My last game, lots of ore and the ability to craft stairs was available right off. Crafting is still bugged, often times you must close the crafting window and re-open it to see all the recipies.  It tedious going from level to level in the dungeon. It's not smooth, you have to wait for the next level to load. Try going down 35 levels or 90. They've fixed that a bit with being able to contruct a teleport carry it with you and then being able to drop it anywhere you want so you can teleport back and forth, unless ofcourse you don't have the materials or levels to make it, then it's a pain. Usually around 20th level you have what it takes to craft the town portal. Until then, load, load, load.  In dungeons, the only thing you find is paintings, that you can't make. Otherwise it's the usual tools, armor, weapons and misc junk.  There's 90 levels to explore. I've only gone down less then 45. I have all the best armor, gems, weapons, enchantments, and my charater is max level (50), so what would be the point of playing. Unless you're into having many characters and doing the same things over and over. There's really nothing to do now, except beautify my house or dig for more ore/coins/items to sell, but again, what's the point.   While the dungeon floors are randomly generated, they're all the same. You fight the same monsters on every level, except they're just a higher level then the previous. Up top they level with you.  Ranged weapons are it. If you have a melee character, expect to die alot. The farther down you go, the more ranged monsters you encounter.  It doesn't look like it, but your charaters inventory is small, so you're constantly going up and down to drop off items.   Game store description says 8 different biomes, I've played multiple characters and only found 4 (grass, desert, swamp, snow) on all of them. Unless they're also counting underground (underground and 2 types of dungeons (but they're really the same, just different graphics)) and little ponds scattered around, so I guess that makes 8.  Edited : In the last update, I forget when that was, they added a copper lantern post to the game for additional light. What a utterly useless item. All I found myself doing is constantly getting stuck on it, back to torches, atleast you can walk thru those. Game is still bugged greatly. And the new patched added new game bugs.  I do like the farming aspect, but after a while it becomes tedious, so it's just better to buy things you need (after you build your town center).  You'll find things that are pointless, their crafting was never incorporated.  Added note: Does not support WASD. Instead you hold down W and move the mouse in the direction you want to go in. This results in often getting stuck on something. You can't rebind the keys or invert the scroll wheel.  Update: Haven't touched this game in 2 years, nothing has changed, all the bugs are still there.",-1,0
4069765,314450,Saviors,"short:I recommend it for all ppl who like shootem'ups in general, but consider that it doesn't feel like a true arcade or classic game, which is the reason why I don't recommend it.   Saviors tries to bring the bullethell genre on a next level and misses the point. The gameplay is not comparable to normal shmups. That's ment in a bad way. The gameplay just feels plain. . The design hits the standards , but is more generic than outstanding. The appearance of the on the topscreen are making the game in some cases more confusing than fitting. The soundtrack isn't unique as well. There is one soundtrack to go for, the one in the trailer. The others are just like 'not there!'...they sound monoton.   It's a playable little shooter for a short time. You are free to change your loadout in terms of weapons every level. Which is nice. But you don't get an arcad-ish feeling, when playing. That's propably the reason why I dislike this game. The game can be very challenging in the harder difficulties which is awesome. however, the graphics are kind of a downer in that part.

The 'Recent' user review score is no longer corrupted - I guess this one one of those games that was being screened by false ratings - and has been exposed by Steam's new system.   How this product has not been pulled based on its blatant misrepresentation and frankly shockily poor quality is stunning. From insane load times to clunky controls and graphics that are 15 years out of date (yes, 15), it's a stuttering, ugly, mess - even with a high-end PC and post processing you don't have the kind of quality the adverts suggest. There's a reason that the camera is moving so fast in the advert - it's so you can't see the horrible quality of the graphics.  This king has no clothes, and he's warty, fat, and outdated. Avoid this game. Enough said.  PS: When a game is still proudly announcing in its main description its major patch (SP1)... from 10 months ago... you know there's a problem.

4078697,315860,Celestian Tales: Old North,"This is one of those games I just barely can't recommend. The biggest flaw is the fact that it's part 1 of a bigger game. I'm fine with games being in parts but you need every part to stand by itself. This feels more like a prologue to the actual game.   The positives are the characters. They are varied, funny and have some depth (but the game is too short for any real character building). The only problem with them is that you have to replay the game 6 times, once for every character, to actually get there story.   This is as the developer say, a story focused JRPG with interesting and intriguing choices. But the choices are way to few. Several times I waited to make a choice and the story did it for me. I think that if you got to play all characters stories at the same time (you play with all of them any way) this feeling might not have occurred.   Now for game play. The mechanics I felt were good but the variety of enemies where low... really low. And most of it where cosmetic ones. Only the fairies felt like they where different and even the secret boss wasn't unique, just bigger and stronger.   I have to point out the fact that it was one of the few non-sexist games I ever played. All characters were of different sexes and it only mattered for sexual preferences. That's all to rare to see even in this day and age.  Visually it was mostly really nice. I did think some of the things stuck out a bit. Most of the time I enjoyed it though but wish for bigger areas in the future.  To sum this up. Hopefully I can recommend a bundle when all parts of this game is out. It has huge potential and I will definitely give the second part a chance. I enjoyed my first play through almost entirely so if you really miss a JRPG, pick it up. I can however, as thumbs down shows, not recommend it as a standalone game.",-1,0

4094581,316810,Shadowcrypt,"not what i expected at all.. the combat gets really boring real quick, and i didn't even like it to begin with. i expected something more Link on NES -like but instead the enemies continue walking towards you to the point that they walk right into you instead of stopping and fighting, making everything even more annoying. i get that the dev went for a bit harder combat, and i love hardcore 2D platformers where volgarr's one example of a hardcore old school platformer done right, but the difficulty in shadowcrypt just feels cheap as hell and the way you have to play the game just isn't enjoyable at all.  i even took up these issues and more with the dev who basically told me that this is his vision of the game even though i said that the number of people who'll actually enjoy this game is minimal. well.. i hope you enjoy your vision mr dev now when no one else is. the game had an all time peak of 17 players the month it got released, after that it's gone between 1-3 the following months and 0 the last 30days.  i thought it looked really kool but got this crap instead.. what annoys me the most is the missed potential here. with some fine-tuning and adding something more to the gameplay than running through 'catacombs' for fun with no real incentive. -A big DO NOT BUY on this one-",-1,0

4099672,317360,Double Action: Boogaloo," Double Action: Boogaloo  You form a special sort of bond with someone the moment you chase them off the roof of a skyscraper to claim their life before gravity does.  Double Action (created by Vino) is a spiritual successor to The Specialists, a Half-Life 1 mod which saught to recreate The Matrix in a GoldSRC environment. With the inclusion of a stunt button, you could dive, slide and flip your way around a low-res version of the one and only Lobby. After a few years of updates to the engine, it was rendered nigh unplayable, and extremely buggy. And then along came Double Action, aiming to be 'the most stylish game ever created,' and bringing about some of the most fun I've had in a video game to date.  We all love over-the-top action movies, even if some of us would never admit it. Watching somebody leap through several panes of glass firing a high caliber assault rifle is just plain exciting. Getting to act out these scenes of violence and death defying acts is a few steps from Nirvana, and Double Action is the metaphorical Buddha of this cocaine coated dream.  While it is hosted on the source engine, (meaning it has its hiccups here and there,) Double Action is a solid, crazy fast and absolutely bonkers experience. Movement is quick, whether you're jogging, sliding, or diving. The gunplay isn't the most refined you can find in a game, but feels nice and tight and translates well from first to third person. The scoring system, which is entirely based upon style, offers even more incentive to throw yourself around the environment. The pool of default maps is not massive, but quality shines brightly over quantity. Mastery of stunting is rewarded by fluid movement around arenas which are a nice mix of claustrophobic corridors and wide open deathboxes.   At the end of the day, Double Action is just a source mod. However, it is incredibly clear that years of time, effort, and care have been pumped into it. Sure, it may be a bit rough around the edges, but you  certainly  won't hear me complaining while I'm powersliding and firing two high powered handguns into the air.",1,0
4101539,317410,Color Symphony,"I really don't like this game. At first, it's a little interesting, it talks about how you were betrayed by your friends,going back to get revenge, then it starts you on some tutorial levels, that basically show you that you can change the background by pressing z/x/c, and if the background matches the color of an object, the object disappears. For me, it just got worse from there. The double jump is much similar to if you had rocket boots - unlike most game where its the same height as the normal jump or less, this one is about 5 times bigger, and can kill you because you can reach off-screen areas with it (like spikes that you didn't know were there). The worst part for me was how if you get hurt in any way, there's about a 15 second long animation just for you getting back up, and its really bad, too, because you're flashing the entire time so it looks really chopped up. And when every other object can hurt you, it makes this game really boring. Another thing I found annoying was how bad the controls are. The controls in this game are insanely clunky, the color buttons can't be spammed the way they SHOULD BE, and the movement buttons just don't give you the feeling of truely being able to sontrol your character, which, imo, should be top priority in any platformer, because in platformers, death is very frustrating, but whats much, much more frustrating is when the player dies because the controls were poorly done. On top of that, this game fails to keep me interested. It gives you the same 5 problems over and over, just in a different order. Honestly, I'm really disappointed, this is the kind of game I would've expected from a Game Boy Color, not Steam.",-1,1
4102010,317410,Color Symphony,"I really like the idea of this game. It's a very nice proof of concept and an approach to a puzzle plattformer that differs from many others. It relies on colours and making quick decisions while jumping between the platforms and trying to avoid the enemies. However, it falls flat on its nose in two aspects. Firstly, the time it takes to be able to move on after hitting something without dieing. It doesn't get frustrating with time, it's frustrating the first time. The second or third time you have enough time before you can continue playing to seriously ponder just quitting and finding something else. Even though restarting when you actually die is a lot snappier, it too is just that bit too sluggish before you can try again. And you will have to try again, which brings me to point two: the controls. All platforming games relies heavily on responsive controls and clear, distinctive movement of the character that makes it possible to judge your movement with a high degree of precision. The controls (I'm playing on a keybaord, by the way) sometimes feel sluggish and inexact throughout. The movement feels choppy and the animation and movement is sometimes a bit stuttering. As I said before, controls that feel smooth and exact and the ability to preciesly judge your movement from the animation and graphics are the hallmarks of any good plattformer. Quick, action/puzzle plattformers more so. This game sadly lacks in both aspects and leave a lot to be desired. Movement is inexact, the controls sometimes sluggish, and the character bounces off edges he oughtn't.  All in all, I do like the game as such, but it falls flat where you would hope it would shine, which transforms it from an enjoyable game into an exercise in futility and frustration.",-1,0

It is so rewarding as well, as I would mine for hours and then figure out I had way more supplies than I needed. I gave that away.

It fixed at least one game-breaking bug that annoyed me, but I can't speak about anything else, since that would require a lot of playing. My opinion: too late. During these 5 months or so I kinda lost all interest.   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Pains me to do so, but to keep recommending this game (and I did it since the release) feels unfair.  I really liked SH:A and spend a lot of time playing it. It's not a hardcore strategic game at all, but it was a great and fun experience, with all RPG elements and customization options to play around with. The DLC packs were adding more chapters and campaigns, so it felt better and better... Right until the Dark Angels DLC release.  It added a ton of game-breaking bugs, half of weapons stopped functioning properly, some missions couldn't be completed , etc. There always were some bugs, yes, but devs kept fixing them rather qucikly. Last patch (August 2015) didn't fix all of them, at least I couldn't finish a certain level with it.  The dev team is currently in a pretty bad shape, so I don't expect any more patches, which means the game most likely will stay in a broken condition. Which is a real shame.",-1,0
4104635,317710,Velocibox,"I've been following velocibox since it's alpha/beta stages and it's really grown on me. The premise of the game is really simple, collect 6 cubes per level to advance to the next level. There are 9 levels for normal mode, each with their own different challenges and obstacles. Losing in any levels causes you to restart the game from level 1 as the game does not have any checkpoints or saves.  While that may sound rather unfair, each level is finely tuned and well balanced. There are multiple ways to overcome obstacles in your path, and each challenge often teach players new ways to overcome previous obstacles. Velocibox gives you a very strong sense of achivement and progression when you're finally able to deal with the levels you've previously cursed and raged at.  It is by no means an easy game, but it's definitely a rewarding game that you'll come to enjoy playing after hundreds of attempts. Velocibox is the game that'll get you saying 'Just one more try! I can do this!' over and over. Good luck with this game, you're gonna need it in Super Velocibox mode. Get ready to meet your new best friend: Level 1.",1,0

4105162,317820,Guild of Dungeoneering Ultimate Edition,"Enjoyed it. Got exactly what I expected, which was what the promo videos advertised. This is a low-frills indie with a lot of personality. I wish it was longer, but it more than delivered on the price point. Might go back if they produce more DLC and sell it at a point I don't mind grabbing a bunch to breathe new life into it... as it stands you get 3 regions of content with a 4th offered as DLC.  Plays like a board/card game -- in a fun and interesting way. Monsters and characters have a starting 'deck' of abilities and the gear you find gives and takes away different cards and bonuses... it's easy to pick up but has a lot of depth. People who like CCGs (or appreicate their mechanics) will find combat in this game as enjoyable as I did. Basically you have health, attack and defense moves. Cards you play do physical or magical damage, physical or magical defense, and grant or subtract health and cards from you or your foe. There is also unblockable attacks and attacks that 'first strike' out of sequence. coupled with some interesting class abilities combat has a lot going on in it -- harder or easier starts, greater or weaker apexes for different classes, and advantages and drawbacks that make things like enemy selection thoughtful and meaningful.  It's a good game. If there is a heaven for Indie developers that do not use the title to ♥♥♥♥ on the consumer, these guys are going there.   Recommended.",1,0
4105766,317940,Karmaflow: The Rock Opera Videogame,"Karmaflow has the worst soundtrack I have ever heard in a game.  It cannot be overstated just how bad the music is, there are just so many uninspired, chug riffs with overwrought female vocals or dumb male growls. Whoever wrote the music has spent way too much time listening to bad 90's gothic metal (which is pretty much all of it) and have something of a penchant to smother everything with cliche keyboards to cover up for a lack of decent instrumentation. I keep getting this Arcturus or even Diablo Swing Orchestra vibe from the whole thing, like they really want that bomastic, avant-garde feel but more rooted in a traditional prog/power metal style because it takes way less effort.

4106076,318020,Act of Aggression,"It's a blast with the strategy. A 'WORHTY BUY' if you are a big RTS fan.  A very well optimized PC game with beautiful detailed graphics.   There is a lack of a tutorial, but if you can read &amp; watch YouTube Videos then you will be fine.   *****Please invest in the initial butt kicking you may get before getting better, and before writting negative reviews because you suck at learning and applying a little bit of perseverance.  In it's current state: Just jumped from a 3.8 to 4.1 out of 5 which is fantastic, and this is only the beta.  Let them fix the helicopter and attack pathfidning issue and it will be a classic.  Let them add mod support, custom maps, and 4th Faction (a Eastern Coalition Faction of Russia and China uniting) with good balancing and it will be in my top 10 RTS games of all time.    I own just about every RTS you could think of. If you are an old school RTS fan then you will really enjoy this. It does need a little bit of work, but if you miss old school RTS action then please pick this up.  Infantry are useful, and the fact they are safer in buildings early to mid game ROCKS. So many other RTS games get this wrong. It should take a certain units &amp; a little bit of time to root out an enemy in urban combat areas.  You can heal infantry and repair buildings, and I hope they do not cave into changing how hard it is to take a base that has a good defensive set up which reminds me of 'Red Alert 2.' You actually have to think in order to take a base, what a concept. :)    The negative reviews are from some RTS gamers that are spoiled with the recent slew of quick, fast paced, and simple RTS mechanics. Yet this approach has taken most of the fun out of the word STRATEGY from the RT'S' genre of gaming.   It also appears many of them have not taken the time to invest in understanding how the mechanics work which are not super new if you are an experienced RTS gamer (casual or hardcore.)  If you are disgusted with the way DoW 2 went downhill MP wise from Dawn of War 1 and highly disgusted with the way CoH 2 went downhill MP wise from Company of Heroes then you will really enjoy this game.    Note 1: The Economy Is not as bad as Supreme Commander, please don't be scared of it. It is slightly more difficult just by a simple notch than most RTS games, and I mean simple. It took me 2-3 long skirmish matches to get the economy down pat, but it was not that hard. It also involves a certain strat in what you build and at what time you build it just like SC 2 early game, but after that then you can start to pump units out.  Note 2: Helicopter Animatiojns The animations of the helicopters is really bad, but hopefully once they fix this it will just add to the loads of fun you will have playing each faction and yes it will take you time to learn each faction but not as much as you think. ____________________________________  Update: 4-3-2016 Original much better than the new Reboot.  We get to keep the original but they had to dumb this game down due to the annoying spoiled gamers that want things simple and fast paced.  Original= Recommended for RTS Vets &amp; People with an average or more than average sized brain. Reboot= Recommended for Simple Minded gamers with a slightly smaller than averaged sized brain.  Not that having a smaller brain is a bad thing. The game can still be fun, but the Reboot has lost a lot of the strategy options and variables that made the original an 'instant classic' for me.   Note: We get to keep the Original and play both games so YES buy the game; also a shout out to the Developers for allowing us to keep both &amp; for all their hard work to make this game appeal to two different camps of RTS gamers.   Thank you Devs and If you read all of this review then what are you waiting for- BUY THE GAME NOW! Grrrrrrrrrrrrrr :)",1,0
4106619,318020,Act of Aggression,"I can see why younger multiplayer fans would give this a thumps up, it was designed for them. Speaking as an older player that perfers single player these days, I feel disappointed.  Eugen Systems always put more effort in to multiplayer in their games than they do in Skirmish or Single player. It has been a consistant problem in all their games so far.  Even though single player fans dont always want every map to be mirrored or fair and do want to be given control of their armies early in a campaign, and do want some sort of credible back story. Eugen Systems always fail to deliver those things and insists on leading the player around by the nose in its single player campaigns.  I do not believe Eugen Systems understand what sort of player actually plays RTSGs in single player. The whole Player dreams up his own strategy aspect of RTSGs seems to elude them as they tell players what to do instead of letting them get on with it them selves.  Multiplayer has traditionally been a way of evading responsibility for making good AIs and good single player features that do require more work from the Devs. Multiplayer does not need any of that, it is the easiest RTSG to make, so it is bad sign when a dev skimps on single player. It means they skimped on other areas of the game too. Areas even multiplayer fans would want and those areas are the areas that makes games like these in to classics rather than releases that get forgotten within 2 years when the multiplayer attraction fades.  What Eugen Systems have done with this game is make everything utterly and completely fair for multiplayer fans and in doing so destroyed any real attempt at strategy for everybody else.   Every map is mirrored... they are ALL utterly fair..... But I ask you, was D Day fair.... was Stalingrad fair.... was the Blitz fair, was the Battle of Britain fair, how about the Alamo... was that fair ?  Yet Eugen Systems war sim is very fair.... and dull... and boring.....   I had to force my self to play it because nothing about this games single player features was remotely interesting.   Funny thing is, they announced a sequel to this game before this game was even released, which is a sign they are about to repeat the same design mistake that they make in all their games.  So my advice to you is this, if you see Eugen Systems is the developer and you are not a multiplayer fan... save your money... buy another game. If you are a multiplayer fan and you see Eugen Systems is the developer and the game is more than 2 years old, save your money and buy another game.  Eugen Systems games tend to die a death online after about 2 years.... so its only selling point disappears after 2 years normally.  Not recommended unless you are a multiplayer fan and the game is still less than 2 years old.  5 out 10.....   For single player fans RUSE is still their best game even though it has these problems. Thankfully you can spend your UBI points earned by playing the game to get the D Day map which is not fair and is there for fun to play in single player. RUSE is actually a very good game, far better than this and cheaper too since it is about 5 years old.  PS This game was released on 2nd September 2015.... so all those 2nd September reviews are first day of release reviews and they gave this game a very big Thumbs up on day 1. Which is now slowly disappearing as people actually play this game for real and give it a more realistic score.",-1,1
4106682,318020,Act of Aggression,"No idea why I bought it. It's a generic toyplay unit-hunting, not an RTS\wargame in any way. Wanted full-scale epic modern battles. Got unmature children sandbox with military toys. Yeah, tanks shooting no further than 20 meters, epic. Annoying FoW in which assault helicopters can see about 30 meters away. Terrain elevations don't affect unit LoS. Infantry can pass thru urban arcitecture (e. g. walls and fences) and objects freely. Units can shot thru most buildings constructed by player. No unit formation move and units always tend to sink into each other. Single player campaign is a joke. Soundtrack requires itself to be muted. Oh, I forgot the nukes! Worst nuclear weapon I've ever met in a whole genre! Boring, unsofisticated, repetative. But in the end I'm the one to blame. Should have learned more about the game before buying.

4115235,319280,Yatagarasu Attack on Cataclysm,"I know this will be an unpopular opinion, but after waiting for this game for so long now... after playing it I am a little disappointed. When I say 'No' to recommending the game, that's unfortunate because I really wanted to recommend it for my love of fighting games, but just not how it is now as it doesn't stand up to current-gen titles. I'll give my 2c on the pros and cons as I see them.  I don't mean any insult by having the cons list larger than the pros, and the development team should be praised for bringing out a fighting game with their own IP; this is just an opinion.  Pros: - Love Letter to the old-school fighters. Basic combat that is relatively easy to learn, even more so if you come from a fighting-game background. - Good Musical Arrangement. Techno-Japanese? I'm down for that! I could watch the intro over and over. - Fantastic Manga/Anime artwork. The intro is pretty cool, and the character art on the selection screens and in the story mode is well-done and finely detailed.  ---  Cons: - Too much of a Love Letter to the old-school fighters. Too basic in it's combat, and while I put that as a Pro it is also a Con. Too often do I find myself wanting to do air-dashes, air-recoveries, counters and all the more new-age utensils the modern fighters provide. - Reso-what-now? No resolution options... AT ALL. When you start the game an external-launcher will let you select windowed or full screen, but not at what resolution. Then in-game in the options menu there's no option for it either. When played in Windowed Mode it is a startling 640x480! So don't play it in fullscreen, especially if you have a widescreen monitor as it looks really rough. - Sprite Detail. Hand-in-hand with the low-res nature, the sprites don't hold their own when scrutinized closely, especially in full widescreen mode. - Character Cast. Only 11 characters. Not too much of a big deal. - Character List. You can't press down. Only left and right, which alternates you up and down through the characters on both rows. Why is this necessary? - Announcers. They put some form of 'announcer' system in the game where you can choose an announcer (who I assume are pro-fighter players) to say random things like 'Stuffed!' during the matches and pop their very rough-pixelated faces onto the screen. Too much of a disconnect during rounds. - Text. The in-game text for things on the main menu, continue screen, etc, look like they were just run through photoshop and had some basic outer-glow filters slapped on them. Minor, but seems very quick and dirty. - Menu Screen Confusion. Two arcade modes? 1st one is Arcade and the 2nd one is Story. There's no help-dialogue when you mouse-over them to let you know, so that could be changed to ease confusion.  There we have it, that's currently what I think of the game. So sadly, it's a No from me. A good effort, but just not enough in my eyes. I'll play some more, maybe get some more perspective, but that was just my early impressions.",-1,0

Even if it isn't as scary after countless gameplays, but it's still as stressful as all horror games should boil down to and I love it!

Like the world doesn't exist. When I am in this game, everything else disappears. When I reluctantly click on exit game the silence is deafening. Sickening.

4132930,319910,Trine 3: The Artifacts of Power,After seeing this on Early Access it was a no brainer for me to get it as I am a big fan of the other two games.   However the early access builds didn't do the game justice in my mind so I stopped playing and waited for the final release.  When it was released I was suprised how quick it had been finished and started playing and to my delight the things that had put me of like the different controls and jittery gameplay had been cured. The controls worked fine and were easy to get used to if not to easy it seemed at times that the character AI did most of it for you. The game played nice and smooth with the trade mark graphics looking as stunning as ever although Zoya could of been made to look a little prettier.  On a downside the game isn't that long and it does kind of leave you feeling like the game was released incomplete or with the thoughts that there would be DLC to come in the future. This now turns out to be not the case there is an explanation from frozenbyte in the dicussions thread as to why this not going to happen.  Does this put me off recommending this? The answer is no you need this one in your collection if you are a fan of the series but maybe wait until it comes on sale if you think the price is two high.   Well done guys   ,1,0
4133186,319910,Trine 3: The Artifacts of Power,A big improvement on the second game. The puzzles and level design are more inventive with fewer frustrating seesaws. Shame they cut out skill trees and alternative weapons.,1,0
4133823,319910,Trine 3: The Artifacts of Power,"Trine 3 is an experimentation that didn't really work out well from the change from side scrolling to 3d for the trine series  pros  - music is great, same storybook fantasy feel - The graphics are nice but honestly think they looked better in trine 2  cons  - The game developers ran out of money basically so yeah the story doesn't even end properly as the adventures find one piece of the item they need and the game ends there. You don't even fight the main antagonist so you can basically assume about 1/2 to 1/3 of the game is missing. So it's essentially a 6 hour game. - I think they did an ok job with the controls considering, but you die ALOT to falling off things because it's hard to judge depth in a 3D game with a fixed camera, you have infinite resses basically unless all your party dies so it's really pretty hard to even fail this game.  - There also seems to be far less puzzle solving than in previous games and much easier, a few times I literally said 'is that it' when you put 3 boxes on 3 tiles to open a door. _ The characters have been stripped down of abilities, the magician can only summon one box, no planks even, the archer basically just shoots a normal arrow and can tie off objects, the knight is the person you use most of the time, he's really the only character that can fight and has the ability now to charge and do aoe stun attacks  I bought this on sale for $5 and really that's all it's worth, a 6/10 is generous, there's too much missing to really give it a better score compared to previous trine games, if you like trine give it a go but don't expect much.

4134636,320,Half-Life 2: Deathmatch,"What's the point of this game? It's nothing but spawn campers insta kills and it's hard to move any where without getting INSTA KIILED! I launched the game for the first time thinking it will just be last man standing, but then I saw the title screen and there were rebles and combine, so I thought ok so it's team deathmatch and I joined a server with a decent amout of people in it and the first thing I saw was a player flying straight twords me and one shot me with an smg. I was starting to get confused because the description of the game says 'Play straight deathmatch or try Combine vs. Resistance teamplay.' But it doesn't say anything about spawn camping or insta killing. So I tried another server and the same thing was happining people camping every where because they knew if they moved any where they would die. So really this game is the devil in disguise, don't get this game unless you want to be that guy. I'm lucky though, I didn't spend any money on this game, it came free with half life 2 episode 2.",-1,0

4135994,320040,Moon Hunters,"Despite the leading review's criticisms, this game is wonderful.   Ushered into a world of confusion and tumult,   Moon Hunters   welcomes the player into a world where they are the storyteller and listener. As the player dies and lives the again, the stars shine on each playthough, hinting and leading you to more possible stories for you to experience.   It should be noted, however, that the player should be willing to play through a story again and again. A single playthrough can last between an hour and an hour and a half.  Still,   Moon Hunters   is RPGs at its finest; welcoming a player into a world where they forge a story.",1,0

Novarapters are to fast and to much health, not to mention there 1 hit kill F*cking pounce. -Horrable hit detection for t-rex and spino. Not to mention there are 3 F*cking spinos at a map at a time which respawn in 4 seconds and 1 shot kill you. -Some maps are awful for humans(some for dinos too) -At times you spawn under the map or on a cliff, over the sea too. -I spawned in a cliff once AND I WAS A F*CKING SPINO A 9 TON F*UCKING LARGE 60 FOOT ON A CLIFF.

4147360,321800,Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition,"Note: I recommend the game, but don't recommend Ehanced Edition. The original Icewind Dale is a good game and you should try to play it.  I really would want to love the game, but I cannot. I played in original Icewind Dale and can tell that IWD:EE has a very few differences from it, but will cost you almost twice (!) more! Let's look more closely on Enhanced Edition features: - widescreen support. A really good thing, but you can download widescreen mod for free (because it's free mod from fan of original game) and get the same result; - brand new interface. Yeah got it, it actually looks nice; - class system from BG2: new classes for characters, new spells. But even Beamdog themselves telling, that they didn't change game's balance for this new system, because 'IWD is a really hard game even without balance tweaks'. Still not convinced; - bugs. We cannot went from it, can we? IWD:EE has bugs, many people that give the game a negative review telling about that. Original game have fan fixpacks, Enhanced Edition haven't. I myself encountered a very annoying bug with all animations being very-very slow and it never was a problem with original.  So I really cannot recommend the IWD:EE. Just buy the original one. It has pretty good tactical gameplay, marvellous mods, fun and challenging battles (battles are the center point of game, don't buy it if you don't like such things). Buy IWD:EE only if you have a good discount and you hate to mess around with mods. And maybe if you want to play your Icewind Dale on Android or iOS.",-1,1
4147377,321800,Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition,"Is nostalgia a good reason to buy a game? Probably not. In its day this game was a lot of fun however by today's standards it's lacking.

So I let this remake steal almost half an hour of my life and being trashing my fond memories of this game before I said no.

4185350,322500,SUPERHOT,"SUPERHOT- the game where time moves only when you do. Well, actually it's the game where time moves slightly slower than normal when you're not moving, but I guess that the former makes for a better tagline. The idea behind SUPERHOT would be a novel concept, indeed, if the game contained anything other than that (minus a Mario Party style minigame that you can play on the home menu for funsies.) For you see, the game seems to believe that the gimmick alone is enough to sell and be entertaining. Sadly, it is not.  To the game's credit, there were elements that I, personally, found enjoyable. The starting levels do a good job of showing off your character's capabilities and limits. This powerful opening is why you'll find more than your fair share of let's plays and first impression reviews of the game singing nothing but praises all over the internet. The environments are detailed and interactive, with the ability to pick up various props and hurl them toward your enemies to disarm and stun them. The physics have that classic video game-y (is that a real adjective?) feel to them, as killing people causes them to flail around helplessly as they swiftly become intimate new friends with the flooring. It doesn't take long for the tranquil stream of positives to be overflown with a torrent of negatives  To start off with, the story. I can see what the developers were trying to accomplish, with the commentary on video game culture. You play as an overweight, awkward, lonely gamer (that hit a little to close to home) who finds a popular new game that all the cool kids are playing. As he plays it, strange things begin to happen, as the game begins to harrass him through his computer. The setup is fine, albeit cliche, but my main gripe is through the presentation of the story. The game is told, through the most part through text conversations between you and your friend and an evil A.I. thing. In order to text them, you must mindlessly smash your keyboard as words show up on your computer (kind of like what I'm doing right now.) It doesn't take long for the gameplay to grow tedious, as weapons have little variety, enemies do little to no strategy other than to run at you, arms flailing, and there isn't any real variety to the levels, other than kill all the other guys or don't let the other guys kill you. Sometimes both. As I mentioned above, the whole tagline is that time only moves when you do, but as I also mentioned earlier, that is a bit of a lie. you could stand still to strategize the best way to dispach your foes, but if you do, don't be suprised if you get killed by a bullet from behind that you didn't see coming, because enemies don't make any noise other than the occasional gunshot or the dialogue I make up in my head ('Hey, Phil, did you check out that sporting event last thursday?' 'We can continue this later, Ronald, I'm busy getting myself slashed in half by this guy.') Eventually, the game introduces a new function. By befriending the killer A.I., you get the power to switch bodies with your opponent, and cause your old head (to an extent, your opponent's head) to explode. While this can prove handy to get out of certain situations, you could always take the easier route and just shoot them. This brings me to my next point, shooting. For the beginning of the game, this was never a problem, but later on I got rather annoyed with the kickback of the guns. Due to the fact that time doesn't move very fast in this game, it takes around five to ten seconds to be able to fire again while standing still. It will take faster if you walk back and forth, but then enemies will have no trouble killing you. You end up having to stand there, waiting to shoot, gazing upon your opposer's fine, glassy features. The same goes for your enemy, but then an intense firefight just turns into a game of When Will I Shoot? as you constantly stop running toward your enemy to make sure that they aren't seconds away from making you significantly less alive than you were 3 seconds ago. All and all, after a while the game just starts to feel long and redundant, not unlike this paragraph.  Now, don't think that this game is a lost cause or anything like that. I believe that a few patches will do more than enought to turn this game into a fabulous first person shooter with a great mechanic, but at the moment, my advice is to hold tight and wait for the game to update, if the devs decide to. Which hopefully they will. Please?",-1,0
4187238,322500,SUPERHOT,"Very quick first impressions review. Dubious pricing aside, Superhot is fantastically fun and amazingly tense as you dodge bullets with pinpoint precision and shatter your red, polygonal enemies as you play through the game - or are you really in control? The plot is executed very cleverly, the mechanics never seem to feel old or stretched too thinly out, and all it's already one of the best games of 2016 in my humble opinion.",1,0
4187772,322500,SUPERHOT,"A very fun and interesting game. For one thing this game is very nice to look at Bright red , white and jet black just give this game a great visual look.   The gameplay is very ingaging you might think that the fact the game moves when you do might make the game easy it does and dosen't it more or less allows you to make desicion when it comes to actions but if you got bullets coming from all direction or a shot gun blast a few inches from you face there isnt much you can do.  The story is alright nothing really to write home about it(If you seen videodrome then you might get a kick out of it) had a few moment where i was like wow that was pretty cool and i espically like then ending very meta but the fun (and vaule imo) dosent come from the story it comes from the challange modes/speedruns of lvls/Endless mode/ and unlockables wich this game has in a fairly good amount that i cant wait to get every achivment in this game.

Every day's round became a challenge and as I got better with placing the dice I saw my strategy improving as well as my taste for human flesh but gosh darn it we all made it to Mars around my 35th try.

Repeat 8 times.   There, I just saved you the money on buying Tharsis.   Tharsis is a game with an interesting concept, great theme, and absolutely terrible execution. I'll admit straight-off that I prefer games that are more skill-oriented than RNG. Still, I can enjoy a good RNG game now and again, as my Steam library attests.   Tharsis isn't a good RNG game. Winning it requires 5% skill (of which it will require approximately 15 minutes to master the 'intricacies' of overlapping Doctor and Captain benefits, banking research in one area to clear impossible challenges in another, etc) and 95% luck.  Tharsis is Snakes and Ladders, Sorry!, Monopoly, and every other Hasbro ameri-trash board game, only with a grim-dark sci-fi theme. Take 100 players who know the basics, give them the same conditions (emergencies, round choices, etc) and the same dice rolls, and the outcomes will be the same for every single one of them.

PROS: Looks nice Decent music Fun interface and game mechanics  CONS: The only way I can sum this up is as follows...  When I play this game and pray to the gods of the dice rolls for mercy on the next roll, I realize 1. there are no gods of dice rolls because if there were they would all be evil 2. you are really at the mercy of a random number generator that does not appear to be influenced by 'strategy' 3. the tutorial missions do nothing but slow down the pace of punishment to lull you into a false state of confidence 4. that if I were a truly sadistic artist and programmer that revelled in the smashed keyboards and gritted teeth of my victims, I would make this POS and upload it to Steam under the guise of a 'game'.

However, I can't say I'd recommend this game to any of my friends. It gets very repetitive and despite the pleasant physics, it is extremely boring. Basically, it boasts exploration but the world is limited, there is no replay value and the graphics are left to be desired. I can't say it has made me 'lose myself' in an immersive world or anything remotely like that. It's reminiscent of a lot of similar casual games that came out about 15 years ago but worse.",-1,1

4198506,323320,Grow Home,Simple concept; Fun game.  You grow a star plant by taking the ends of its vine structures and planting them into nearby floating islands with a couple tools to aid you in how you move around.   I personally wIsh it was longer though. I beat this game within 3 hours time which im unsure if worth $8 (It actually went down in price from when I bought it. ),1,0
4198989,323320,Grow Home,"I was hesitant at first about getting this game since so many people complained about how short it was. Though I do wish the world was bigger (or at least somewhat randomized to give better replay value) the game was definitely long enough if you do more than just focus on the main 2 objectives. This is one of those games where you don't mind playing for hours at a time.  There is hardly any conflict in the game. There isn't much dialogue. There's no time limits. But, it doesn't need any of these things - it's just a very original take of a relaxed exploration game. The game does a great job at giving you a sense of depth and accomplishment. Though the graphics are weird, they're also charming. If you try collecting all the power crystals, get all of the life forms scanned, and go for some of the more fun achievements, this game has several hours worth of content. If you ever played Mario Sunshine, you'd probably like this game.  There are a few cons to this game: * On the Linux version, there seems to be a slight rendering issue with the horizon, where there seems to be a black line. I feel like this could probably be fixed if the game supported anti-aliasing (which it could really use). * BUD is pointlessly clumsy. The greatest overall challenge of this game is dealing with how poorly BUD can walk. If you just run on a flat surface and turn sharp, he'll topple over himself. He's also pretty much incapable of walking up a slope greater than 15 degrees. I don't mind climbing but it gets pretty tedious when I need to climb up a slope as shallow as a wheelchair ramp. * I'd have liked the islands to be bigger with more wildlife variety. For an exploration game, it felt a little lacking. * Jetpack usage can be a little glitchy. At least half the times I fell down too far, it was because the jetpack wasn't firing when I told it to. Sometimes, it fired when I *didn't* want it to, giving me not enough fuel to make the jump.  Overall great game and highly recommended. Just take your time with it. ",1,0
4199632,323380,The Magic Circle,"I am of two minds on The Magic Circle because there are some things it does really well and some things it suffers tremendously on.  On the good areas, the graphical design is quite impressive, the sound aesthetic is pleasing, and the overall presentation is phenomenal. Moreover, the story is excellently done. The characters are well developed, believable and thoroughly entertaining to listen to, with top-notch voice acting that makes the dialog thoroughly hilarious to listen to. Unfortunately, when it comes to the gameplay aspects, a dozen little annoyances come up and begin pestering you like dogs nipping at your heels.   The biggest, in my opinion, being a lack of a decent way to organize your minions. By the time you reach the mid-game, you will have recruited a small army of mobs and only be able to scroll through them one at a time or by searching through whatever in your immediant field of view, which bogs the pacing down tremendously. The second being that in the in-game hacking minigame it can be difficult to tell whether the option you are hovering over is the one you are attempting to select or the one right below it, and can easily accidently select the wrong button and have to retry the entire section. An indicator to show whatever you are currently posed over would make a world of difference.  Thirdly is that some of the puzzles can be quite unintuitive, especially if you are going for 100% completion and are attempting to micromanage an army at the same time, related to point 1, above. None of these points are dealbreakers, but they what could have been an amazing game merely good, and it also is worth bearing in mind that at 20$ for an experience that lasts four hours, fans who are hoping for a longer experience are going to likely wind up disappointed.  One final note is that it takes a minimum of two full playthroughs to gain all the acheviements, which I feel is an unfortunate design choice for a humor-focused title such as this. The old adage about a joke never being as funny the second time you hear it rings true in this situation, especially since if someone has already found all of the hidden extras, they are unlikely to want to replay the story again just for completion sake.  That being said, I did enjoy my time playing the magic circle, most especially due to the stellar voice acting the cast put on. The story is definitely the highlight here, and I would recommend it to those who enjoy meta-commentary based games such as The Stanley Parable.  8/10. Overall postitive recommendation ",1,0

4206488,323470,DRAGON BALL XENOVERSE,"Ah, Xenoverse.  I remember pouring hours upon hours into this game when I had it on my Xbox, but those discs kinda got ♥♥♥♥ed. Tried resurfacing them, nothing. And yes, I had two, because one was a replacement for the broken first disc. So, wanting to play this game again, I turned to Steam. Was glad to see it on sale.  Holy ♥♥♥♥ I've been having the best experience with it here on PC.  Something's just... Different. It seems to challenge me, but every challenge is clearly beatable. On Xbox, it kinda got to a point where it was either a breeze or at an impasse due to difficulty spike. Here, it doesn't seem to be the case, and while I'm not sure why, I like the change. It handles well when you've remapped the controls to a scheme that humans can use, and it's a pretty good time. But so as not to be that long-winded, here's a list.  PROS: +Aforementioned challenge +Character customizer, while limited, allows for neat results +It's just plain fun +Music's pretty good +Graphics fit pretty well with the Dragon Ball style  But of course, the game has made some quite questionable decisions.  CONS: -Some missions have, as mentioned, intense difficulty spikes, and the reason is usually because of non-flinching enemies -Some missions with crowds you have to fight can be easy, but are annoying nonetheless  That's all I can really think of. It's likely because I don't look too far into games beyond gameplay, because I'm a simple dude, but in any case, the two cons listed really can get to you if you're not of the temperament to handle them. But all in all, Xenoverse is a good, fun game that I definitely recommend picking up. Of course, the sequel's out too, and I've heard it made some pretty good changes, so I also look forward to getting that. But I digress. It's a good game for those who enjoy Dragon Ball fighting games, and I do, even if I'm not really a fan of the show itself (It has some interesting things about it, though, and don't get me wrong, I don't really hate it).

4215817,323720,Decay - The Mare,"Decay: The Mare is not the typical game I'd buy for myself. In fact, if I hadn't gotten a copy of it in a bundle, I'd probably never even consider in the first place. That being said, however, I decided to play it one night on a whim and found myself pleasantly surprised.  First off, this isn't the type of horror game that controls akin to Amnesia or the like (first person WASD control and all that). It's a point-and-click which brought me back to the era of old school horror flash games. It fits the game well, but not everyone may enjoy the control style.  Secondly, this game is not nearly as scary as I was initially expecting. The suspense, however, had me covering my eyes every time I walked through a door or clicked on an object as I was half expecting a cheap jumpscare which never actually came. Yes, there are some scares (keep your eyes out for the portrait in chapter 2, it's terrifying), but they aren't nearly as horrifying as I expected stepping into the game. This could be good or bad based on your preferences, but my tolerance for fear is low. If it had been toned up I probably would have quit the game before I finished it.  The music is phenomenal and sets the tone very well for the gameplay and the setting. The hallways and rooms you explore become tense in places where needed, puzzle areas provide a moment of clarity, and the moments of downtime in between are accompanied by slower, more deliberate and minimalist tone.  Finally, the story develops a lot more than I would have thought - what at first seemed like a simple method of dropping the player into a degraded, unkempt mess of a place and leaving the story at that actually gradually reveals a full-fledged and engrossing storyline, with a satisfying ending.  The game is a little short for its price tag - I'd wait for it to go on sale before deciding to pick it up - but what I assumed was a game that would gather dust and never be played transformed into an experience that I enjoyed upon reflection, and I'd highly recommend making the trip yourself.  8/10",1,0

4223253,324310,Bus Simulator 16,"Bus Simulator 16 was developed by still alive studios and published by Astragon. The game released on the 2nd March 2016 for a price of £18.99.   In Bus Simulator 16, you are in charge of a bus company and must also drive around the bus collecting and dropping off people on various routes. During my hour of playing this game I had many ups and downs but the eventual ending was me stuck outside my bus and also stuck outside the depot with no way back.  Positives: + Good attempt at an entry level bus simulator – The game was designed to be a really good bus simulator but unfortunately falls quite short of that bar. The game feels more entry level but a good attempt at it. + Steam Workshop – With steam workshop there will be mods to improve the game and adding own designs and busses. + Tutorial – The tutorial is pretty good and I’m glad I did it. The amount of options and choices to the game is overbearing at times but I feel after an hour more confident to try and drive a bus around. + Multiplayer – This is a great add to the game, you can play online and manage routes together too, the only problem for me is that I lack friends with the game  + Cops/Police – When I was idle at the station trying to figure out buttons and such a Police car went flying past me with the lights on. I found this so cool – however it may just be normal for most people.  Negatives: - Floaty handling – The handling is not too good on this game and most the time I end up crashing and bashing when taking corners because the handling is too light. - Overwhelmed – There are just so many options, buttons, choices in which you must do and then to add to the top of all that the doors get jammed and the customers expect you to give them change from money which you can’t really make out. - Voice acting – If you can make it through the game without laughing at the terrible voice acting I commend you. I laughed quite often due to this fact. - Long loading times – It may just be my PC but I experienced agonising load times and very bad FPS. - Price – I feel the price should be halfed for the product because although you get a lot of content the quality is subpar.  Unfortunately I felt this game had a lot of potential but the execution was pretty bad. I was hoping to finally get an Omni 2 experience on Steam but unfortunately this falls well below expectations and to me feels more of an entry product. I could only recommend this game to people with low expectations or standards (huehue). I played this game only for an hour but I was left out in Sunny Springs in the rain, trapped from my bus and depot. Although I slate the game I enjoyed it for what it was but can’t possibly recommend the game at the current price point. I’m just glad the game never crashed on me because that would’ve been the icing on the cake.  Score: Wait for a sale",-1,1

Negs: Too random but i supposed it was made that way.  This is a choose your own adventure with random combat, and by random i mean random. When you start a game you roll the dice to get stamina, luck and skill points, this is the most important part of the game because this points are used in combat and in random scenes when luck, skill and stamina will decide if you go on or lose the game. The combat is too random but interestig, it takes the skill points as base and adds the number goten with the dice. After the outcome of a turn you'll have the oportunity to test your luck but every time you test it you'll loose one luck point and you'll won't want that. I think the game is worth the price, i payed 54 mexican pesos, like 3 dollars on sale.

4228750,324740,The Warlock of Firetop Mountain,"A fun and close replication of the book with a new set of annoyances.  The good first. There are some heros to choose frpm, a currency system that allows new heros to be unlocked, the combat system is basic but fun (more so that rolling dice anyway)  The not so good, there is no developement of the original book (which was hard), many unforseeable basically chance based decisions that will kill you or grind you down to the point you die. The down right awful. You will die a lot, the events will grind you down and the combats kill you, and when you do you get a few restarts from when you last rested and thats it. Then you have to start over, rinse and repeat, same rooms, same encounters, same events. Once you get the combat worked out it becomes a grind to remember the right rooms to go to the right choices for the items etc.  There was an opportunity here (without much effort) to randomise the dungeon etc but unfortunately it is rather too close a recreation of the original.

4238113,325600,Sword Coast Legends,"For those that enjoyed Baldur's Gate/Neverwinter Nights and the Black Isle/Bioware comes the most recent Dungeons &amp; Dragons pc game.  How the game plays: Fans of Icewind Dale and Baldur’s gate will find many parallels with the combat in Sword Coast Legends. It is a real time with the option to pause with the space bar. AI is fairly intelligent for those that wish to control only their player. The pacing of each round is as fast Baldur's Gate and faster than Neverwinter. In the end very similar to Dragon Age: Origins. In the campaign setting characters do have roleplaying interaction and choice. The game is based off the 5th edition rule set. It is not a direct translation as the Gold Box games and Temple of Elemental Evil. But the system itself makes for a rewarding twist on the D&amp;D experience.  DMs have two modes to expand the games fun. The campaign editor allows players to make their own adventures. They may publish and share using n-spaces server. DLC is planned for the game and players can expect more monsters and tile sets in the future. The game's campaign creator does not have the flexibility of Neverwinter Nights, but it does have a level of simplicity that makes campaign creation easy and enjoyable.  The second mode is the DM mode. This is very similar to Neverwinter's persistent rules but provides a more like a competing version of DMing where it is a four players versus one DM interaction creating the adventure as both sides play along. DMs win threat points to use against the heroes as the adventure goes along. N-Space encourages using the voice chat system to emulate a table top story driven experience.  Sword Coast Legends is not a table top emulator. It also is not an exact copy of the Neverwinter Nights series. It most certainly is not an MMO like the Neverwinter or DDO lines. It is a video game version of the table top dungeon crawl game using the Forgotten Realms as a backdrop.  I would highly recommend this game to fans of D&amp;D that enjoy a group oriented Forgotten Realms experience. As more and more DLC and fan based modules are released I suspect that many purchasers of the game will be buying into more of a community than a large scale reskin of the same old game. Well worth the price tag. ",1,1
4238341,325600,Sword Coast Legends,"Just so disappointing. Its like the game can't decide wants it wants to be. It seems set up like an mmo, where you are supposed to alternate through your abilities through using the 1-9 buttons, yet the controls are crap. Amazingly, In a game where you direct a party around, there isn't even a select all button!  Worse, the developers decided to remove so many options from D&amp;D 5th edition that its plays like a half-hearted mmo of D&amp;D. For example, they completely gutted the wizard. You don't choose spells for example, you select abilities off a drop down tree straight out of a copy and paste mmo, thats it.   This is a game designed for some spastic clicker, not for someone looking to play real D&amp;D online. And even for all the clicking, the combat is boring! Just so grindy and samey, just bland :(. On top of that, the story is even worse. Really people, 2015 and unskippable dialogue! This game forces you to list to its every god-awful plot dump and every god-awful conversation! That is inexcusable.   In short, If you want a good single player D&amp;D like experience, play Pillars of Eternity, which has great combat and a good story. Do not play this.  ",-1,1

Just, just don't buy this game, If you have ROME II, you will get similar experience but with worse performance.  Update : Even at this late, there is no more patch or fix. The performance is very atrocious, way more so than ROME II. CA really abandons this game. Lesson learned painfully, I will never again give my money to all of CA / SEGA product. The truly great Total War titles are from 2000 until 2007, after that it goes downhill and just a cash cow of the franchise.

Almost everything is more expensive which presents more of an economic challenge and if you are waging war on Rome be prepared for lots and lots of rebellions. Bigger map adds some fun if you are a Horde and if you feel like destroying all of europe you can become a horde and raze every city you come to.

I have next to no desire to re-read content just to play specific routes. I appreciate this is common for VNs, However the 'choices' for IMHHW were so anodyne re: who looks best in a bikini, whom do you wish to accompany to the supermarket, and were so few and far between, that I find it hard to retain any sense of credulity that such choices presented a potential route.   Perhaps I'm playing in the mind-set of an early 40s British guy which is the issue, and one who is not completely au-fait with VNs. But I'll be damned if I will spend hours re-reading the same dialogue, especially narrative that wasn't terribly enthralling in the first place. Except for Armane (for obvious reasons), I never really felt a connection with the characters: Aoi felt like a diluted Murakami protagonist (minus the ubiquitous cat) , whilst Kotori had annoying mannerisms, especially her frequent open mouth - jabbing finger expression.   I get that the game pushes you down the main [Kotori] route, but to such an extent that with the exception of Ageha, the relationships with other characters were hardly developed beyond the usual harem tropes.  What it boils down to is that excellent production values and musical score aside (the standard to which all VNs shall be judged production wise), the actual narrative itself was fairly soporific. I did enjoy IMHHW otherwise I wouldn't have persisted. That said, it is pretty much standard high-school angst / shojo, unless you have a fascination with the technical detail for gliders.",-1,1

The tutorial is woefully short and doesn't explain deeper game concepts leaving ou a bit confused.  And the elephant in the room the MT's. Well I don't use them ever and I hope this game can be completed without them if not that would upset me. My problem came when I entered town after the first dungeon I had about 224 gold on me. I did not know what each of the town areas did so I visited them. Annnnnnd... Well after each area visit I had a random encounter that sapped gold from my coffers in the end I saw each area but purchased nothing and left town with only 4 gold as the game 'randomly' took the rest in encounters.

No.  But If you want to play it that is your choice if you need help making it here is a  YouTube video of my experience.   http://youtu.be/60okEuibbLE    I'll be making more just because I do love the gameplay maybe the developer can choose to make the game better with all the loot they get.

WASTED is a fun, abide occasionally stupid, FPS dungeon crawler with RPG elements. In a world where only the biggest, dumbest morons survived Reagan's nuclear annihilation of the world, you, the player character (Either your own custom starting character, or a random waster who has 'commandeered' your previous character's shack and possessions) are on a quest to get plastered with irradiated alcohol, which will give you a mutation (Perk), or 'Hangover' which may or may not be positive. To get the booze, you have to dive into a dungeon, or 'Cooler' to get that sweet booze, fighting raiders, angry mutants and, again, Paramilitary organizations who have every reason to kill you. You need to reach the floor exit as fast as possible, because if you take too long, a Purifier (a 600 health, power armor clad murder machine with a minigun) will spawn to murder you, and everyone/thing else on the floor.   The game has randomly generated dungeons, with random routes, enemies, and item spawns. However, because each floor coincides with a specific area of the cooler (living quarters, storage, evacuation area, ect.) those floors will draw from the same level assets. This can make multiple dungeon runs quite repetitive, as there is a real incentive to cut short cooler runs to store particularly valuable loot, or because you found a hangover that is particularly good, or fits well into your character build (which sends you back home, where you then start over again from the first floor on your next run).   There are also random 'buzzes' (temporary buffs/debuffs) which can be obtained prior to, or during a cooler run, and can be anything from stat boosts to having your cross-hair hidden. The unmarked flasks inside the dungeon are a particular source of rage in WASTED, as it's safer to ignore the flasks then to risk getting a crippling debuff, particularly on a character you like. This is on top of the already difficult game, where enemies, despite intentionally being stupid for your own entertainment, can do some smart-ish stuff that might kill you (like swarming you with suicide raiders).   The story is charming, in a stupid way, and the combat is fun, but the repetitive nature of the dungeons and the frustration that can result from a crippling debuff or sudden death can act as a serious turnoff for some players, but if you don't mind either of the above issues, WASTED is a fun dungeon crawler with a charming take on nuclear annihilation.",1,0

I suppose Windows 8 is as much to blame, but I can't recall having ever purchased a game from steam that has worked 100% correctly, if at all. It is a credit to my own stupidity that I keep wasting my money with them.   So to begin with, to even get the game playable, took me a couple of hours of research and tweaking. Then it seems at last, once I fixed the graphical issues, the game is still completely unplayable with the mouse. I was hoping for a joystick game so this isn't such a huge issue, but be advised, that at best, after quite a bit of tinkering, the game will not ever function completely right in windows 8 as far as I can tell.

It's an expand and conquest game, similar to Civ and other turn based strategy games. Where Deadlock shines so brightly, though, is in its charm.  Each of the alien races is a delight. The have a huge array of custom taunts, praises, cowers, and insults which they occasionally lob throughout the game. The races are all unique and don't feel repetetive at all.

Time runs up and you're back to the beginning to try another round.  But it's not interesting enough to warrant that.  Then again I've only played 25 minutes so maybe there's more too it. Multiplayer maybe only have the single missiles too.  I played with DS4 controller but the analog sticks isn't good for this since they react slowly and eventually your cat speeds up.

It's unforgiving and difficult, and the game has a somewhat sloppy feeling to the controls, so you need to use the arrow keys for best results. The limitations and high expectations of Arcade Mode leave you frustrated and dissappointed. The other game modes are boring. Once the novelty of the bells and whistles wear off of this game, you will find it to be a chore to play. This is not a good sign for a score attack game that is supposed to have good controls, and addicting gameplay that will keep you coming back for more. You won't find that here.

4284025,330470,Over The Void,"Over The Void is caught between wanting to show you something and requiring you somehow arrive there on your own.  As an art piece it's beautifully bizarre, hyper saturated and full of weird twisting architecture inexplicably suspended in midair. The elegantly subtle house soundtrack is contemplative, maybe even a little meditative, pulling you into somewhere that feels familiar yet completely removed from our own world.  The problem is that Over The Void doesn't want to simply be a piece of art, it wants to be a game, and it doesn't know how to wrap its audio and visuals into something interactive. Your goal within each of the dozen or so levels is to hit buttons randomly positioned on parts of the environment whirling around you. To do so you place cross shaped platforms at will, either stationary or one which propels you higher into the air, until you've hit every button and the door to the next level opens. Aside from being extremely simplistic, navigating through these levels is rather abundantly tedious, as trying to platform upward requires you to look down and as a result it's rather hard to know where exactly you're going. This leads to a lot of bumping your head against the ceiling, or pieces of the environment, or random invisible walls that regularly appeared out of nowhere and proceeded to pound me toward the abyss below me as if the heaven's had seen fit to strike me down.  It's interactivity that feels forced, shoved in as a means to give you some objective to take on beyond admiring the world around you and perhaps to attempt to hide the complete lack of any context or narrative for what exactly is going on. I'd have been content, if rather confused, had Over The Void been nothing but a pretty screensaver for me to float around in, but its attempts to make itself more of a game cripple it and cause you to be so preoccupied with finding these blasted buttons that the artwork just becomes another obstacle you're required to somehow get around before moving onto the next level which may or may not work as intended. The abundance of control and performance issues make an already simple game feel unfinished and entirely unfocused, existing for no discernible reason than to be this incomprehensible thing attempting to ride the coattails of a recent trend of games as art that completely misses what makes any of them worthwhile.",-1,1

4284995,330670,DiscStorm,"DiscStorm has just hit Steam for PC &amp; Mac from Mastertronic and XMPT Games. After a few teething issues getting into the game, which were quickly sorted out by the extremely impressive response time from the XMPT Games, I stepped into this battle arena having only caught glimpses of a few screenshots beforehand.  DiscStorm attempts to bring an 8-bit Sega Master System/NES feel to its graphics and it achieves this goal extremely well. I could believe that once again I was sat – near thirty plus years back – in front of my television playing Smash TV with Mario like toons, though admittedly DiscStorm is nowhere near as violent as Smash TV, as here we’re throwing lethal Frisbee’s in this arena.  I’d advise you to take a few moments and jump into the practice Dojo just to get a feel on the controls and movement of the game, as all be it appears to be easy it can be quite tricky and frustrating. The frustrating element I believe – for myself – lies in the fact I am using a mouse and keyboard and the first screen you meet on DiscStorm in recommends you play this game with a Gamepad, which I don’t; this I believe will hinder the average player.  The single player mode is a series of mobs fights and you can easily path these mobs and bunch them up, bringing them down with one nice throw. As you pass checkpoint your progress is saved and if you do die you return to said checkpoint, leaving the game however doesn’t save your progress within the level so you will have to grind through that level again; unless of course you completed the entire level. Something I found a bit cruel was the lack of health regens that were dropped, after you first encounter with a mid-level boss you’re given one energy bubble back, but you were then expected to proceed through the next round on a heavily depleted life force.  The multiplayer mode is unfortunately only local multiplayer, so there is currently no chance of joining up with three other random’s around the globe to lob discs at their heads. You can set up a game against bots if you – like me – have no friends, this then immediately shows how hectic the game can become with three other people playing and you realise you need some more training at this game.  The music keeps faithfully in line with the appearance of the game, you would believe that this game has been pulled from a cupboard back in the mid-1980’s. The developers certainly have their hearts firmly planted in the era of the Sega Master Syst...

4285529,330820,2064: Read Only Memories,"Read Only Memories is honestly a pretty disappointing game with some great promise, but ends up lacking. Getting the good out of the way, the game really does look good, and while it's going for the retro look that most indie games fail to emulate, it pulls of it pretty well making it look like a very pastel looking Sega Genesis/ Mega Drive game, and an early 90s anime. The soundtrack it's the best part of the game, really uses a great mix of instruments and chiptune very well, utilizing it to atmospheric moments that are appropriate to the locations and moments. If anything, I recommend the soundtrack than the game itself. If you're expecting this game to have a similar level of challenge seen in Snatcher, look elsewhere, this game is pitifully easy with little to no challenge whatsoever. None of the puzzles will ever get you stumped, and I honestly don't even know why they even bother putting in combat in the game. It feels like this game wasn't really made for gamers, and with its usage of LGBTQ characters and themes, it feels real insulting for LGBTQ community, basically saying that they can't handle a good challenge. I know several gay gamers, and they're very good at the games they play, and take them seriously too. Plus, I feel as though this effects the game's story. There's never really any moments of satisfaction because you never really worked for the objective. This doesn't really help when there are moments in the game where you could do something, but some convenience happens, and on what could have been, really doesn't happen. Other than that, the plot is really mediocre. Has a very rushed pace, and none of the concepts and issues the game brings up never feels like we delved into it enough. They're interesting, but very short lived, and could of done what Deus Ex takes its time to discuss about these concepts and issues. The game really lacks good build up, which makes the game feel really empty that way. There aren't really any intense or cool moments, it just feels like, intense moments happen, but with no build up, they lack impact. There are a few entertaining characters, but most of them aren't that interesting, and feels as though they make the characters a part of the LGBTQ spectrum first, and their personalities secondary, making the game feel really shallow because of it. I find the plot mediocre, mostly because of robotic partner Turing. The plot does revolve around Turing, and I think the character is alright, it has enough personality to where you can have empathy with it, but Turing is not enough to really save the shoddy pacing unfortunately, which is why I also don't think the plot isn't necessarily good. Along with its lack of twists, build up, and satisfaction, I can't honestly say the game is honestly good. It's like I experienced a short film with a lot of fascinating things happening, but it all goes too fast, and it just ends. I really don't feel the fifteen dollars is really worth it. Just get the soundtrack and enjoy some nice tunes.",-1,1

4288817,330830,Tales from the Borderlands,"When I played it the first time, it honestly enjoyed it. It was my first game in this 'choose your own adventure'-book style, and I enjoyed the funny and over the top story. Some parts in Episode 4 and 5 were unexpectedly sad, but I still would have recommended it for the earlier episodes, and brilliant scenes like the    employee gun fight on Helios station   .   A year has passed, and I have played 'Life is Strange'. Since I enjoyed 'Tales from the Borderlands' the first time, I started a second playthrough. That was my mistake. 'Tales from the Borderlands' is by no means a bad game, but I noticed how horribly unpolished it actually is.   First thing I noticed when I started it was the language. I am not a native English speaker, but I always play in English (if that is the original language of the game), because of the superior voice acting. For most of the games I own the language is set by the Steam settings, it used to work for this game too. Seems like they patched that 'bug'. The in-game language is now the system language/region of the computer.   After I taught my computer English I could finally start playing the game, but I gave up after 2 Episodes.   1. It is impossible to skip dialogues. Or cutscenes. Not even the recap at the beginning of an Episode. If you played the game once, and know that a certain part of the dialogue or scene is not interesting, have fun watching it again, completely. That alone does not sound too bad, does it?  2. It gets frustrating if you are trying to test different choices, because there are so few checkpoints. Decide to reload from the last checkpoint to see how the conversation could have turned out? Prepare to watch three minutes of cutscenes again. Or more. The same happens if you actually manage to die during the fight scenes.  3. Controls and Camera. In some parts of the game you can move the main character in third-person view. Usually you have to scan things with his special ability. That works sometimes, but every time you are in a big room game desing fails completely. The controls are clunky and slow, there are tons of invisble walls, and the camera angles are set. Even the camera angles for the scanning ability are set, depending on where the player is standing. That would be fine for a game with 1D-movement, but they give you an illusion of exploration. It is impossible to stray even a little bit from the rails they put you on. It would actually be more enjoyable if just 1D-movement was possible.   Maybe my mistake was playing TftB again after playing 'Life is Strange'. I know that TftB is older, but freedom to chooose the language, skippable cutscenes and voice lines, as well as a decent camera system is no rocket science.  If you dont mind paying more than 20€ on a 12 h movie go ahead, its not bad. But don't expect to be able to discover all the choices without a lot of frustration, and don't be disappointed if you just want to look around the usually well designed environments.",-1,0

4293245,330840,Game of Thrones - A Telltale Games Series,"The stories you play through are an interesting addition to the World of Ice and Fire lore. True to Game of Thrones' culture, you are faced with impossible and painful choices that can lead to unexpected outcomes. While the story itself is interesting, the choices you make do not seem to change anything in the game (as others have noted). Additionally, it has been quite some time since the latest episode has been released, leaving me wondering why I paid for a half-finished game. Hopefully the reason it's taking so long is that Telltale wants the next episode to be much better than the previous ones, though I doubt that will happen. Overall, this has been the least engaging Telltale game I've played.  In sum, this is not a must-buy game. If you really love Game of Thrones and are willing to spend the money, then why not? If you're not a huge GoT fan or are expecting something as engaging as The Walking Dead or Tales from the Borderland, don't buy this game.",-1,0
4293301,330840,Game of Thrones - A Telltale Games Series,"This is one of the most minimally interactive games I've ever seen.  It has all the drawbacks of every TellTale adventure game. As usual, you're presented with choices. But you don't have enough information to make a meaningful judgment about which choice is best or what the mechanical consequences might be, or if you'll have the opportunity to change your mind later. There's a time limit, so by the time you're done reading all the choices, you don't have any time left to think about your decision. It's very stressful at first, and then you realize that none of your choices mattered anyway, because you're going to be going through the exact same sequence of scenes no matter what. End then at that point, you realize that nothing you do in the game matters at all, and there is literally no reason why this is a video game and not just an animated miniseries.  This particular game is even less interactive than other TellTale games. In Wolf Among Us, at least you got to investigate crime scenes from time to time, even if the outcome was always the same. There's nothing like that here. Just meaningless TellTale choices and the occasional combat scene composed of a series of quicktime/Simon Says events.  The only thing I'd praise this game for is the cool-looking hand-painted art style.

4296958,330840,Game of Thrones - A Telltale Games Series,"There is little in the way of gameplay and I don't feel that I'm making meaningful decisions. I'm left to watch everything play out but with the visual settings turned to their highest the graphics don't look very good. Edges are jagged and objects are colored outside the lines like a bad children's crayon book. It runs slightly choppy on my system with a Core i5-3570k overclocked to 4.2ghz, Crossfire 7970s, and 8gb RAM.  Besides all this, the story so far (in the second act) isn't anything special. The exposition is very clumsy at times, and I'm not engaged in the same way as Walking Dead or Tales from Borderlands. I would recommend either of those over this game.",-1,0
4298635,33110,Alien Shooter: Revisited,"Alien Shooter: Revisted is an updated version of Alien Shooter. It has been ported to an engine that looks very similar to Alien Shooter 2, and comes with all the improvements you might expect from that process. Some of the flaws that haunt the original game still appear in this one, however.  Like you would expect, Alien Shooter: Revisted involves shooting lots of aliens, and that may be an understatement. On some levels your kill count will be up in the thousands. You control with WASD and shoot with the mouse, holding down the left button to shoot and using the cursor to aim.  The style of this game is an isometric top down shooter. I found that the isometric view could actually be a hindrance at times, with many enemies being hidden along the wall. You will find yourself being injured by aliens that you could not possibly see, and I have a slight problem with that.  The graphics have been drastically improved from the last version, and some light RPG elements have been added. You can purchase upgrades to your skills or weaponry, however a lot of weaponry can be found in the open throughout the levels. The enemies and characters have some additional detail over the original, and the environments have been give a new coat of paint. This looks more like a commercial title and less like a free flash game that the original did.  The game still lacks voice acting or much of a story. You just kind of dive in to the scenario, committing genocide without much thought. With Alien Shooter 2 having much more story going on, it makes its absence well missed in this game.  While Alien Shooter: Revisted has welcome improvements over the original, it is still missing too much to warrant much of your time. Without much of a story going on, and the upgrade elements still feeling a little too light, I would skip this in favor of Alien Shooter 2: Reloaded or another shooter.  Grade: D+",-1,0
4300451,331440,bit Dungeon II,"Good for the price, fairly short however. It's a roguelike game but doesn't offer much to keep returning to. Ranged weapons seem to be overpowered which means you keep them despite finding much higher level melee weapons.",1,0
4301930,331470,Everlasting Summer,"In my opinion, this was an excellent visual novel. The graphics were beautiful, the soundtrack was great (literally moved me to tears sometimes, some of the songs gave me chills they were so emotional and beautiful). The plot was pretty good, too. Yes the plot had some holes in it, but that can be expected from their first game. Overall, this was a great visual novel. If you like visual novels, like multiple-outcome games, or are just curious about this game, get it! It's free. FREE! I mean, it wouldn't hurt to at least try it. Also, if you're looking for a game with a lot of boobs or panty-shots, don't bother, it's not (entirely) like that. Even though there are a few panty-shot, low tops, and a few sex scenes (which are blocked out of course), this isn't a game entirley based around getting a girl, banging her, and living 'happily ever after' in La-la land. It's about an average guy, falling asleep on a bus in Winter, waking up to a Summer pioneer camp in the 80's, and maybe even find love, all the while trying to figure out why and how he's there. So in summary, buy the game. It's well made and enjoyable.",1,0
4303456,331570,Wimp: Who Stole My Pants?,"Yet another promising platforming game destroyed by... guess what? Poor controls, of course. With the funny, cartoonish artstyle, the outlandish humour and the evolving 'player states', it could be a very good, if not very original game. Without consistent and snappy controls, however, it starts downhill quickly, and in the middle of the second episode (after innumerable failures of the fire state's controls), I just can't be bothered any more. Such a pity. I truly wonder, to be honest - is it really so hard to make controls consistent and resposnive, that 80% of platforming game devs fail to achieve it? Such a waste of potential :(  ",-1,0

4307744,332200,Axiom Verge,"Review updated  Fantastic Game! Full of great, responsive Metroidvania gameplay. Very close feel to Metroid, without seeming like a clone. Great ascetics and atmosphere. Menu systems are great, as are the map and weapon systems.   Gameplay: Controls are very tight, and I highly suggest that you play this one with a PS3/PS4 controller. Having the dpad in the main spot and the precision of the gamepad is vital near the end of the game, where you use one of your swifter moves and require precise use of it (or at least I did to stay alive) during the final battle. Doing this double tap Left/Right with a joystick is ok at first, but it is very difficult near the end.  The weapons are fantastic, and I implore you to find them all. Each weapon as it's great strengths, even if they felt miniscule in the final few rooms, where the enemies are quite tough. Superb selection. Movement is tight, and I very much loved how responsive the game was.   Story: Stunning, while you are in a place that you don't understand, the alien story is nice and simple, while leaving ambiguity in droves, even after the end of the game. Smells like a sequel :)  While games like this (due to ADHD) tend to make me only play in small bursts at first, man, was I HOOKED near 2nd half of the game, going after every nook and cranny of each map section. Even though I took time to explore every area I could, I ended up with a 90% map completion, and a 60% item completion. Maybe I will come back at some point to see what else can find.  Great game if you are a fan of Metroidvania-type games.   OS: SteamOS Video Driver: Nvidia, proprietary Card: Nvidia GTX 970 SC CPU: Intel i5 @ 3.4 GHz HDD: Seagate SSHD RAM: 8 GB DDR3 Launch issues: none, fluid and works well. Music: PHENOMENAL, pulse pounding, great bass Menu system (main), very good, buttons fully configurable, nice aesthetic, dpad + thumbsticks work Pause menu - nice quick access to controls to do on the fly button swaps. Controls: responsive Visually looks great Well animated for it's style Capped at 60 FPS it seems, and it runs great.",1,0

4308157,332200,Axiom Verge,"I've been very enthralled with this game. It felt so much like Metroid, the controls were solid, the puzzles where on point. One thing I like about old-school games was their reliance on being a good observer, figuring things out for yourself, using skill and repeat play to master a game.   So why am I not recommending Axiom Verge? Trolling  I'm very near the end of the game and now, suddenly, the game is not about skill or observation anymore. It's about placing enemies in spots that will compromise and kill you without notice. Super-turbocharged ghouls exploding out of the floor in places that aren't marked. Divebombing nats that attack you from off screen and take out 1/4 of your health per hit. The games no longer a challenge or fun. Now I'm being trolled by the developer and I don't like it. They took a wonderful game and ruined it by making the last level no fun to play.",-1,0

4309220,33230,Assassin's Creed II,"     Disclaimer: I would like to thank the random kind stranger who has given me this game as a gift.            Plot     – If you haven’t played the previous game yet, like I did, you’ll probably be confused on what is happening during the first part of this game. But even so, the writers did a great job of giving out stories about the happenings during the previous game, giving you at least an explanation on what is going on. Similar to first one, you will still play as Desmond Miles. But instead of tracing back to Altair, you will relive the life of Ezio Auditore, a Florentine nobleman during the Renaissance period. You will discover your father’s secret and join the Assassin Order to help them end their feud against the Templars and finally achieve true peace.  The game is long enough for you to be satisfied, as I’ve poured more than 20 hours to finish the story. Even though it may sound generic to some, but I assure you that this will leave you pleased as this is one of the greatest stories told in the franchise.        Environment and Design     – It is exactly how the Renaissance was pictured in the paintings we can see on museums. The game also boasts the popular and fictional landmarks that are found in different parts of the map. Other than the resemblance, most of them were also a big part of the main story. And this is a great way for players to learn about these historical places.  The cities have the golden yellow effect, though it is probably just the sun, giving it the nostalgic effect. With five different maps that you can go to, you’ll have a huge sandbox to roam and play on. Thus, they’ve included fast travel stations for you to switch into different maps trouble-free. And this will come handy as you progress towards the game when you start jumping into different maps or going back and forth to your own villa. In this, you can manage the infrastructures to be built and a chance to increase your income.         Gameplay     – Even though the game is about being on stealth to pick off unguarded enemies, parkouring from different rooftops to get to your objective, it also offer an impressive close combat fights. Even though there are times that the game doesn’t give you choices on how you want to assassinate a target, it is still satisfying task to do. If ever you’re in help, there are three different factions that you can rely on. Obstacle course or puzzles can also be found in-game, even though they aren’t that easy they are also not that too hard. But in fact, during the start of each puzzle, the camera will give you an idea on how to complete the course. For a game during its time, these features are awesome and very satisfying.        Controls     - I had trouble playing the game for the first time, I even had some trouble towards the end. First, the buttons shown in HUD aren't clear. I had to check the controls in the options just to see what keys to press to do a specific action. I didn't know how to sprint not until I finished the first fight of Ezio. And I'm a little impatient person, and the game punishes you for that. Specially during free running, I tend to hold down the Spacebar, even if I don't really have to, resulting for me to fall down.        Conclusion     - If you haven't tried any Assassin's Creed game before, just like me, I recommend that you either start with this or the first game. Whichever, you can assure that you will have a great time on finishing them. And for me, this is one of the best story this franchise has.   Since this game requires Uplay in order to be played, I suggest that you turn off the cloud synchronization as it may result your save file to be corrupted on accidental shutdowns.

The character roster rotates periodically so you will be able to play as any character without spending a dime. There are even promotions occasionally which give free characters or loadouts. The characters are all very unique and enjoyable and the world is vibrant and beautiful and very stylized. Every other FPS that I play now just feels sluggish and unengaging.

PROS:   - Graphics are amazing for it being a free to play, which will be a huge hit in the free to play gaming community, considering there's not many free to play first person shooters who achieve this.   - Playing Style: Now, I'm not the best player in Dirty Bomb. But it feels smooth and really easy to control. You'll have to fix the mouse sensitivity, however that shouldn't be an issue - fixing it, I mean.  - Customization/Game Modes/Progression: These days most free to play games have these basic game modes in which are common and overused in my opinion. DirtyBomb has an objective for almost everything just so you can support your teammates in some fashion or another. Not very many free to play games have that. Customization, this game is said to implement it. I've not seen it yet, however if it's anything like Brink, which obviously it's at least simalar in some fashion, then it's more than safe to assume customization play a huge part. Progression in Dirty Bomb is amazing. When you level up, you'll be given crates, keys and cards. They'll play a huge part in the game as well. I won't explain that part because they can explain it to you better in their videos.   CONS:  - Published by Nexon  - Makes people worry whether it'll be pay to win or not  - Since it's published by Nexon, this may also have an issue with hacking considering Nexon is known for Combat at Arms. Which wasn't a bad game, just the people who ruined it were bad individuals.   - Also, maybe it's just me. However in game, certain maps. I've been running into bushes as if they're solid objects. I believe that's a bug that needs to be addressed!  Would I recommend this game?  Hell yeah! Despite who it's published by, I believe the game deserves you to at least try it and then judge it based on that. Not who published it. Because they didn't make the game, SplashDamage did. Might I add, they did a wonderful job in my opinion as well! Continue the hard work, SplashDamage! I'll continue playing as well.  - Gun Haven   ",1,0

4339871,333930,Dirty Bomb,"This game would definitely be one of my top fps games if it weren't for the massive grind it takes to unlock a new character. One match will give you around 200-1500 credits, and it takes 50 000 credits to buy an agent. The rotation gives you 3 players each update to try out, but all that means is that everyone is playing the same characters (especially at low levels).    I truly want to like this game, but it feels like purchasing credits is the only way to actually have fun. When it feels like you have no choice in the way you play, and each match gives you basically nothing towards buying a new character, you will start to feel frustrated. No one wants to grind for weeks just to unlock one character, that's outrageous! If winning a match actually meant something, I might be motivated to play.   Otherwise, the game is fantastic. The characters are fairly balanced, each one gives a slightly different experience, and the jumping mechanics are phenomenal. There is nothing wrong with the actual game, it could be amazing if it weren't for the fact that you are given very little variety as to how to play. This is after I've purchased around 8 characters, I still feel like I'm only playing a demo, and very slowly working towards purchasing the full game.",-1,0
4339998,333930,Dirty Bomb,"Game: Dirty Bomb  Hours Played:11  Recommendation: Don't bother downloading.  Summary: The worst FPS I've played in a long time. After the first matches I played I was left immediately disappointed. The music and voice acting was loud and annoying (and did nothing for flavor). Visually I found the characters low detailed and blurry. The map layouts are shallow, point blank and flavorless. Another issue I found was character/weapon balance (I'm not going to detail the issues, if you care that much just download and be disappointed). After first impressions I pressed on and figured perhaps I'm missing some aspect of the game that would be enjoyable. What I found was a community littered with juvenile, angry, smack talking players. The teenage rage was captured very well by the following comments;  'OMG ♥♥♥♥ yur shotgun you ****** ***** ***** I hope you get aids' - Dirty Bomb Player  'N****s your all N****s!'- Dirty Bomb Player  'SHUT YO HOMO FACE LOSER!'- Dirty Bomb Player  These comments and many more came about during game play! Provoked only by playing the match, playing a load out, asking a question (such as how do you &lt;whatever&gt;?), dying, and other similar mundane actions. After a few more hours of abuse I just uninstalled and figured Id write a review.   On a positive note I did learn a few things playing this game.   1: My mom is very sexually active. 2: I'm an N-word. 3: I'm gay. 4: Shot Guns should be avoided in all social settings.",-1,0

I agree a 64 bit application has more headroom for memory and CPU registers (if they even optimized the game for it), but the 32 bit original had no problem on my PC. The DX11 over DX9 is hardly noticeable unless you play a game of spot the differences, and its not really tessellation or such that's noticeable as much as the lighting differences.   The biggest problem is the complete separation from the DX9 game. My pre-order DLC does not work on SotFS, save games don't work between them, and the most aggravating is the separation of match making servers and inability to play with people between the two versions.

4375364,335300,DARK SOULS™ II: Scholar of the First Sin,"So to preface this, I played Dark Souls and initially hated it. A friend at work persuaded me for months to pick it back up and give it a shot. He also gave me some advice. I eventually relented and picked it up again and fell in love with the game. I should also note, that this was on the xbox. After completing Dark Souls in offline mode I was really looking forward to DS2 and for the PC so I could get more of the online feel of the game. I was pretty excited, purchased SotFS edition and let it download overnight.  I've also never written a review before.  When I started playing I noticed things felt different. I won't lie and say it made me feel good. That little voice in the back of my mind was telling me, 'you've seen this before, a good game comes out and then a sequel comes in trying to change the original formula and making it look pretty, to cash in without offering any originality.' yeah. I stuffed that feeling down. Probably denial on the fact that I threw 50 ducks away and didn't want to face the truth. I pressed on with the game for a while. You'll notice I don't have that many hours into the game, but I put a lot into DS on my xbox.  Then I started noticing the little things. The hit detection was awful. I noticed combat was feeling pretty gimmicky. Before it was a little freeform, now there seems to be rules and gimmicks. For instance, if the enemy misses but you have n't rolled or blocked you are going to get hit. It appears that you must do either to avoid taking damage even if you have skillfully moved away without doing either. This was big in Dark Souls, because that helped you conserve your stamina. A lot of boss fights I would strip down to my shadow set so I could do hit and runs on bosses to avoid their AoE attack. Circle strafing against enemies is pointless, because they merely pivot without actually doing any footwork.  At first, I wrote this off. I thought to myself, 'new game right, so you will have to develop new tactics.' And then I noticed the level design. This made combat even more gimmicky. In dark souls, sure there were choke points and places where you had to fight that generally gave you no advantage (like blighttown or Tomb of giants) but it was a matter of finding the right moveset to use in the situation. In DS2, there are traps and ambushes that all feel exactly the same. Couple that with the lousy combat and the game appears to be more of a gimmick with updated graphics and essentially the same plot sequence of Dark Souls. It lacks a lot of originality while changing the basics of what made the prior game great.  It should be noted, that the director of the first game was not much involved with this sequel. So the idea that it feels like someone took something good and ruined it, might be pretty accurate.  At the end of the day I felt mislead. Like so many things in life, you pay good money for something only to find out you paid for a name, not something of quality. That is how I feel about this sequel. I'll probably wait until my next paycheck and buy Dark Souls: PtD edition. I highly recommend the first Dark Souls, but not this one. This is one that you can easily skip. After all, you wouldn't be missing anything that wasn't better done in Dark Souls with the same plot.  [edit] 3/13/16  I've put a lot of time into the game since the last review. Honestly, I stand by the review I already wrote, but I would like to add a few points and note that I picked this game back up to prepare for DS3.  The game still feels incredibly gimmicky, after a while all the boss fights feel the same with the exception of the fume knight. The only boss that was incredibly difficult (globally has a 93% failure rate) that didn't feel like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I had a hell of a time beating him, but enjoyed it. Sinh was tricky at first but soon I figured him out as well. Anyway, moving on...  The targeting in this game is all sorts of a cluster ♥♥♥♥. If you're in a room full of enemies and you point yourself at the closest one in front of you, 9/10 you're not going to target it. You'll end up targeting something else and most of the time in my case it is something that isn't anywhere near me. One example: Had an enemy in an enclosed platform above me and one directly in front of me. The target locked onto the guy on the platform I couldn't even see. The other issue is when in caves or hallways. You can literally see the enemy in front of you but if he is even slightly close to a corner in a doorway or something you can't target him. All of this might sound lame, if you're a tanky knight with an oversized weapon then it might not matter. You don't have to be as precise. But lets say you're a high dex rapier then precision is incredibly important. You have no swings horizontal or vertical.  Another issue is PVP. The DS2 netcode is pretty ♥♥♥♥. That being said, there are definitely ways to cope with it, but it does change the feel of the game. There are helpful videos that explain it pretty well, essentially you are not where you think you are, but where you were a half second ago. This explains why you would be getting hit when successfully dodging a player or why your hits won't land when you see your weapon hit them. There definitely is a learning curve, but I feel as though this should have been handled better and made pvp more fluid. I have done some pvp, sometimes I'm very successful sometimes not. No worries, but I definitely feel like the latency should have been dealt with.  Finally, the collision and physics in the game aren't that great. You really do get hit by things you shouldn't have. I honestly hate Havok, I think it is a garbage engine. Every game with Havok feels this way. There were times I couldn't step over a 6 inch curb or step. I would get stuck and naturally hit. I have noticed that in PVE spells have a tendency to hit you after they pass by as well. Now some of this might be solved by playing in offline mode. Which requires you to run steam in offline mode as there is no option to do so in the game menu. I've noticed have have taken hits while being behind the enemy and never touched.  I stopped at the final boss and started the DLCs and have completed two and am in the middle of the third (Ivory Crown). Went and killed a bunch of side bosses and looked for notable loot. After a while it all starts to feel tired, everything feels the same, every boss fight is the same. The problem is that when the difficulty of the game is as such, all these issues and bugs make it less fun and really shouldn't be there given the difficulty. The first game is definitely better, the third might be better than this one (hope so). There are definitely still good qualities about the game. There are still bosses that are interesting. There are still interesting areas like the iron keep and shulva. I just want the game to be more polished and playable.",-1,0

4376003,335300,DARK SOULS™ II: Scholar of the First Sin,"Coming back and playing Dark Souls 2 after i\'ve beat Dark Souls 1 i\'d say...7 times. So new game +7. Playing dark souls 3. Only one play through, Haven\'t got a chance to start my new game+ yet because i\'ve been busy working. I\'d hjave to say Dark souls 2 is by far the worst Dark Souls game EVER! The combat is just so derpy and unbalanced, It\'s RAGE inducing.  Dark souls has alway been a tough but fair game. You\'d only get punished if a mistake was made on your behalf.  Dark Souls 2 is nothing like that. Maybe it\'s because of this new SOTFS edition. I don\'t remeber the combat being so lacking and just...unfair. I can really see why now why most call this the worst Souls game EVER!. Which i never used to agree. But, now i do. Long story short the combat Is nothing like DS 1 or DS 3 I could sit here and explain why i think this way about DS 2 but i\'d be here forever lol.   If any of you have played DS 2 which i\'m sure the majority of you have. Then, you\'ll totally under stand where i\'m coming from. If not, stand clear of DS 2 if your new to the series and play DS 1 or DS 3 even. Still a good souls game to play don\'t get me wrong. It\'s just RAGE inducing unlike any other of the souls series. Like i said before, You only get punished in dark souls when it\'s YOUR mistake. But, not in dark souls 2. Either way do what you\'d like buy thr game, or don\'t. Just don\'t satrt dar souls 2 as your first adventure into the souls series. I bought this for $10 si i couldn\'t pass it up.   I already on this on PS3. Before people rag on me saying i only have a few hours in dark souls 1 is because i played it on xbox 360. Didn\'t bother playing on PC at the time because my friends hwre on 360. I\'d only recommend this if you get it on the cheap or if you\'ve never played it. But, only after you;ve played dark souls 1 or 3 first I'd say.",-1,1

What this is not: ¤An entirely brand spanking new game   People buying this who have already played through DSII should not be going into this expecting it to be a brand new game, because it is not. What you are buying is basically original DSII with a fresh coat of paint on it.  You'll be finding new shortcuts, different enemies in different locations, and all kinds of things that are changed, but it's not like you're getting a brand new story/plot. Some items have different descriptions, there's more NPC's available to you to play through bosses with, and with this new version, it's a fresh start. Weapon balance changes, and all kinds of little things. Prime example being chests.

4376945,335300,DARK SOULS™ II: Scholar of the First Sin,"If you want a challenging action RPG experience, this is an excellent choice. However I would not recommend it over the first game which I feel is superior. Here is why.   Scholar of the First Sin tried something different by going for a more open and sprawling game world, but I have to say I very much miss the intricately interwoven level design of the first game. The graphics are 'better' here, but somehow the overall look just wasn't as effective as Dark Souls', which could evoke a feeling of mystery and sheer dread at times. The overall art design of the first game is superior in my eyes.   The abundance of fire checkpoints had a deleterious effect on the mood too: I no longer felt the sheer relief and joy when I encountered them compared to the first game; reaching one was a moment to savour previously, but in this game it's just grist for the mill.   Difficulty wise I found it both harder and easier than Dark Souls. Some bosses I beat in a satisfying fashion, but there were a number of bosses that I had to resort to summoning, The DLC in particular was challenging, with the magic smelter demon after the Iron Passage, and the Fume Knight being particularly nightmarish for me personally.   The game has refined the combat mechanics, and the menu system is much nicer. The community element is fun although I didn't get too deep into it beyond leaving a sign at bosses and summoning for help at times myself.   Whilst the obsurity of the game is seen as a feature by many, I am not so keen on this approach to story telling. For the most part I was progressing through the game and by the end I really didn't know anything more than I won and I was now the king. The thing that I least like about both games is that it is impossible to know where to go next without resorting to the wiki. Again, others love it, but I'd prefer a bit more structure or slightly clearer in-game clues to help me understand where to go next.   It's a tighter, more polished dark souls game, which has gained in some areas (combat mechanics and online play) and lost a little in others (atmosphere and overal design). It nets out a little worse than the first game, but it is still an A+ experience.   Recommended.",1,0

4381432,335670,LISA,"LISA is a great a great game with great humor, tough choices, better combat than in most final fantasy games, awesome music and great pixel graphics.  Combat functions very similiar to JRPG:s, only different things is that you can either use the skills straight out or you can combo them our self using WASD keys for more damage.  When not in combat the game goes on as a sideway scroller, thou you can only use jump if a platform is either slightly above or below you ( you cant jump because you are too dull and could lose a few pounds, according to the game ). Bike chances things as you can actually jump with it. You can also fast travel later on but wont spoil more about that.  Leveling also follows JRPG style you gain new skills as you level up and auto gain stats. You might find items that you can use on character for them to learn new abilities or gain stats.  Exploration and seaching is the key. There are many hidden things and opportunities to be lost and found some of them are affected by the choices you make along the road.   Items and inventory use is very simple and has similiar inventory to JRPG:s. You use jerkys to heal and diet colas to get more sp. Joy is a drugg in this game it heals a lot and makes you joyfull ( buff ), thou be warned it causes addiction that lasts extremely long or longer. Resting can be done in campfires. Choose wisely wher you sleep as it might have dire consequenses even permanent ones. What happens while resting in a poor spot is determined by location, events and random.  There are many querky characters such as Terry the hint lord or The annoying guy. Some characters have to be hired some found. They all have different fighting styles and weapons along side with other gear.  I wont spoil more things so here are some...  Helpfull tips:  -The game is hard so expect to save often and prepare to lose party members, limbs and items.  Saving is done in points similiar to final fantasy series in this case crows, jus remeber to save in different slots as choises tend to haunt you later on.  -I have read that some had difficulties in what keys function, I think its simple: Z for almost everything to interaction to picking up, cancel, etc X for party screen Up key + Z to jump up or down if platform present slightly above or below WASD keys in combat combos F6 for larger screen  -Dont trust anyone they all lie and are full of poo ( nicer word for what I meant ).  -Many hidden things to discover you should try to search every corner and explore every route.  -Killin everyone is not always in your best interest and if you kill some one you will not see what happens to him later on.  -AGAIN REMEMBER TO SAVE OFTEN! and in different slots...  -Praise The Sun",1,0

4396120,337000,Deus Ex: Mankind Divided™,"TL:DR: buy for 5€/$ at next sale, when the game is complete.  Shallow. this describes my Experience with Deus Ex Mankind Divided pretty accurate.  To explain it, i need to go back a little....  *insert random time travel sound*  Back in 2002 when i bought Deus Ex (Publisher: Eidos; Developer: Ion Storm) i didnt knew exactly what to expect. After spending a few hours in the Game, i couldnt stop playin, i was enthralled with the game.  How you accomplish your missions was to a far extent up to you. Multiple Options were available, stealth or not; Vent-simulator or goin in guns-blazing. Furthermore the Story was very deep and exciting. Characters very unique and interesting, the world itself seemed credible.  All in all: i was a big Fan of the first Deus Ex, and finished it about 4 Times by now.   I do realize that Human Revolution was sort of a reboot and some things would be different; but such inconsistencies like the Boss Fights (you had to kill the Bosses, no other Option was available to you) for example, were unfitting for a Deus Ex Game (imho). Or 'The missing Link' DLC ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, which was clearly simply cut out of the Game to sell it as an addtional DLC....  They fixed the boss Fights in the 'directors Cut edition' a few years later, which was free for Owner of the previous Version.  All in all i enjoyed Human Revolution to quite an extent, and finished it 3 Times as to this day.  But even back then i wondered: Why does this Deus Ex game offer less than the Game 9 Years before?!  Ah well, we all start somewhere, they just had to adjust to a game like that; next one will be better.  Well, ♥♥♥♥ me Ladies and Gentlemen, its not!  The Game feels like watching a Movie in Television, and when it gets exciting and you´re close to get some Answers, you get an Ad which forces you to pay an additional fee to see how it ends...   You got a lot of questions during the Game, from the beginning to the End. some of them are gettin answered, others do not, but after the 'end-sequence' you´ve got a lot more!  The first 30 Minutes in the Game are a Blast! Everything is interesting, you wonder about so many Things and you have to take in Praque as a whole. So many nice Details everywhere.  4 Hours later you cant fight the feeling that this is all there is to see. I, for one, never got rid of this feeling. And this saddens me.  Praque and all the other 'Locations' starting to feel sterile, generic as if nothing really matters, it simply fails to enthral you, gets you attached to somethin. All in all you dont give a flyin duck about ANY of the Characters (Adam included) because they simply lack Depth.   the strongest attachment i got was by talkin to an Interpol 'Desk-Jockey' who want nothin more to get out in the field....  Levels are well made though, and there are plenty of options navigating through em, but the Story...the world...your choices in the Game...nothin really seems to matter to anyone in the game.  Another part which is missing: where have Jensen been? How did he end up with Interpol? what happened in these 2 years? (you get a few infos during a side-quest in the game, but this smeels like another DLC opportunity to me...)  On top of it theres this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLC policy, which lets you experience the game as a whole only if youre buyin the Season Pass/additional DLCs. And furthermore, Pre-Orders get addtional content too!  Like a seperate mission (selectable through the main menu) where you explore parts of the Main (!) Story a little deeper. WTF?!  Microtransactions and other Pre-Order bonuses (like additional special-Edition Wepaons, Praxis Kits, Ammunition, Money) are also a huge Thorn in my side in regards of a full priced game.   After 38 hours in the game, im just dissapointed that the Industry nowadays is not able to produce the same level of quality that it did all these years back.I do realize, that its easy to fall prey to Nostalgia, but i dont think thats the case here.  To me its obvious: theyre focussing on milking the customer (DLCs, pre-order ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t,..) above anythin else.  Fine for Square that they were planning a Trilogy, but that no excuse to cut customers short in the most important parts of a Deus Ex game (or any other!). Feels like this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in films where you have to watch 3 Movies instead of 2 just because they could charge you a third time (i.e the Hobbit Trilogy)  My final verdict: if youre a die-hard Deus Ex Fan -&gt; wait till these suckers publish the whole game (most likely in a Game-of-the-Year Edition or crap like that) and buy it in the Sales for 5€ or 5$.   This way you get the whole game (no just some crippled Version of it) and the greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who where tryin to milk you in the first place get less money -&gt; WIN/WIN in my humble Opinion.",-1,1

4400888,338120,Marble Duel,"★★☆☆☆  Marble Duel is a turn based marble shooter. I had high hopes for this one, but was utterly disappointed. The main reason I can't recommend this game is its unbalanced difficulty and a cheating AI. The game is very easy until level 45 and gets insanely difficult from there on. I don't mind difficulty, but this is just frustrating. Also the controller support isn't properly working:  The analog stick is way too sensitive. This could have been fixed with a deadzone adjustment.  My guess is: The imbalance and unexplained menu items come from a removed microtransaction system, that is present in the Android version of the game,  Really lame, And frustrating. There I said it again :D  Too bad - this could have been a nice casual game.  ★★☆☆☆",-1,0

4402607,338180,Batla,"At its core, Batla is a generic and basic arena shooter with a kid-friendly theme. With the trash that comes with F2P games, however, it becomes an uninteresting P2W fest where those who spend more money gain the edge over those who don't.  The guns, movement, and maps are functional, at least. Most of the levels and the way they are designed feel like they would fit in Unreal Tournament or Quake; save for the childish decoration and theme, of course. Your arsenal is standard arena shooter fare; machinegun, rocket launcher, lightning gun equivalent, railgun equivalent, etc. The movement itself feels solid enough, but your options are extremely limited due to the exclusion of bunnyhopping, rocketjumping, or something akin to UT2k4 dashing. However, unlike most arena shooters, there's a slow but constant health regen effect, which I did not find to my liking.  Since it's F2P, there's a cash shop in which you can buy various passive abilities and upgrade weapons. 'Paperclips' are the currency, you either get small amounts from finishing matches, or of course: buying them with real cash. This means that even if you're fairly experienced in the genre, you'll almost always lose to the other person if they've been playing long enough to grind for buffs or they paid for them; which in my experience, was the case in almost every match.  Imagine this: You land a direct hit with a rocket launcher on an opponent. You deal 35 damage, due to the opponent having purchased better armor from the store. You manage to strafe and hop around the stationary enemy, chipping away at what health you can. The opponent then lazily fires a rocket in your direction, dealing 150 damage off of some distant splash damage, because they bought rocket launcher upgrades. Similar situations happen very frequently in this game. Doesn't sound fun, does it?  The community is pretty small but big enough for a couple of games to be going at once. I assume most of, if not all, the players are little kids or people who have never touched an arena shooter in their life. I base this on the fact that a majority of them were only capable of standing still while loosely spraying in my direction with whatever weapon they had in their hand at the time.   To summarize, I can't recommend this. If it were completely free without the cash shop, I could see it as a basic but functional arena shooter. However, the inclusion of the cash shop and the pains that come with it make me give the game a negative.",-1,0

4426741,339840,The Moment of Silence,"This is reasonably constructed point and click adventure with some good points but it has some serious flaws that make the price of £14 way too expensive. If you find it on a half price sale it is worth considering.  The premise of this game is that you are a man in New York who, soon after moving into a new apartment, observes a police squad forcefully arresting and abducting his neighbour while his terrified wife amd son look on. In your attempt to support the man's family you discover all sorts of strange facts that suggest dark and conspiratorial motives for his arrest.  The gameplay is that of a traditional point and click adventure. Most of the plot advancement is through conversation and exploring. There are some inventory based puzzles too, but not enough in my opinion.  The good: Despite the occasional weak translations (to English) the characters are believable and the voice acting is pretty good. The plot is engaging and sensible and doesn't leave any unanswered questions. Object based puzzles are sensible.  The bad: -The pathing is terrible. It is downright difficult to transition between some screens and the main character will sometimes run around in a circle before going where you want him to.  -The scenery involves huge areas that take ages to get across and redundant screens. This makes moving between locations tedious and annoying. This actively ruins one of the better puzzles because it takes a couple of minutes to go from the place where you push a button to the place where you get feedback.  - Advancing the plot relies heavily on triggers. Sometimes those are sensible (like interrogating a character to reveal a new location) but some triggers are completely irrelevant to the plot (for example you know what to do and where to go but you can't do it until you've talked to your friend in the office, who has nothing whatsoever to do with the story).

4431637,340120,Crazy Chicken,"Having an terrible day? Why don't just shoot it out in one of the most well known games of the late 90's?  Crazy Chicken had an small world wide success while being a big thing in germany with many different versions and it also crossed over to become screensaver or wallpaper for many office desktops. The 'Moorhuhn' game series (german title) was incredible and even today no one knows why. Maybe we germans just got so much suppressed anger in us that we need to kill poor little animals with an shotgun to the face while they smile at us with no fear in their eyes.  Anyway, the game is so simple that an infant could learn how to play it and if the 'Trenchcoat Mafia' would have played it before the Columbine Massacre, it would have got blamed like Manson. You aim, you shoot, you reload... that's it. Not very clever or somehow heavy to do and you wonder what all the fuzz is about. Biggest complains came by the german animal-right-society and at that point I started to wonder why they did not complain about the game 'Worms', but they got no faces.  For being an game that was produced as an gimmick to sell an whisky brand, this game has surely come an long way, but is it an good game? To be honest: This is not an good game. It can surely be fun, but only in a kind of retro-feeling-mood when you look back and try to remember all the stupid stuff you did in your life. If you never heard about it, you won't miss it.   3/10 Remember, remember - The 5th of November (1999)",-1,1

4438280,340480,Project Green Beat,"I'd have to say, my initial playthrough was similarly ruined by a drop of framerate another customer was mentioning. As soon as I opened the game, the lag intantly hit. My cursor had atleast a fourth of a second delay on the basic 720p settings, and you don't even want to hear how bad it is as the resolution was raised. It was sad to force myself into going to the lowest possible setting to actually have on-command instantaneous response because in this game, aiming is a vital utility to have. I have the requirements (surpass them quite a bit actually). It would be nice if this was fixed, because a laggy game is not worth 5 dollars (which is the only reason I'm giving this a negative). I've played Unity engine games before, and that seems to be a recurring problem with the program. Maybe something in the script could be affecting the framerate. Now, on the other hand, the story and setup of the game are enticing and neat. The music is something that many people can 'rave' to, and the environments I've played through express a deeper meaning that I intend to explore in time. Until the game is revamped, I'd rather not force myself to play on a low quality setting. I want to fully experience this exciting game in the best quality possible. :) ",-1,1

4451086,342200,MechWarrior Online,"I've played over 10,000 matches of this game between aug 2012 and today but have rarely played it in the last 6 months. This is a great and unique shooter. It mostly feels like you're driving a tank or heavy machinery. The game is about customization too. When you finally own your own mechs, it is a lot of fun buying weapons and upgrades and making your build as unique or efficient as you can. The weapons are pretty well balanced at this point. There have been problems however with game balance for the first 2 years. It seems like every time a weapon system became to powerful they would nerf the heck out of it 6 months later. The fighting in the game is not like a traditional shooter because you have armor distributed throughout your mech and arms and legs and other parts of mechs can be destroyed which is part of the strategy to fighting. Sometimes for example, you want to take out a shoulder where a weapon is mounted or shoot at the legs to take away the enemys ability to move. The graphics are well done in my opinion. They have actually recently gotten better. The gameplay is solid with few crashes. Overall the behaviour of players is pretty good too.  There is a con however. While the game is free to play, playing as a new player is a very punishing experience. As a new player you will not initially own your own mech. You are given a handful of mechs with preconfigurations that are not optimal to go and fight against players who have the benefit of customizing and leveling thier mechs. This means they probably can fire thier weapons with more heat efficiency, move faster, and even turn and aim faster. Not from skill mind you, it is programmed into the game. After you have been sufficiently hazed, you then have enough cbills to buy your own mech. Hopefully you choose a good one because after that grinding for cbills can be extremely time consuming. If you are a crazy person, or just don't care about being at a disadvantage, you will eventually get more mechs and it wont be so bad. This is how PGI gets money from this game. They are counting on you paying money at some point in order to keep your sanity and they charge a premium for every ounce of sanity.  Overall I've spent $60 founders package and another $30 MC and consider it totally worth it. I've had a lot of fun and made some friends and hundreds of hours of entertainment.

4455611,342860,Dark Quest,"First Impressions:  This isn't a bad game, though it is pretty linear and dumbed down compared to some other dungeon RPGs I've played (Claustrophobia: The Downward Struggle, Desktop Dungeons, Dungeons of Dredmor, Warhammer Quest, etc.). Essentially, you control 3 heroes and are tasked with clearing a level. Afterwards, you can use the money you've earned to buy equipment, spells, and some other goodies. If you're looking for an in-depth and complex dungeon crawler, this is most certainly not it. If games like Dungeons of Dredmor tend to overwhelm you with too many available options, then this might be more your speed. In the end, $5 isn't a bad price for what you're getting here, though other games certainly do the genre a bit more justice.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVzmzu5NkA ",1,1

4457387,343100,Overture,"SUMMARY: A seemingly simple, brutally hard, speed roguelike that has unexpected depth and unlockables as you play. A fast, twitchy grab-the-gold, kill-the-monster, go-as-deep-as-you-can game great for people looking for that experience. Has a lot to offer, but takes some patience.  Overture is the classic, stereotypical dungeon crawler/roguelike boiled down to its basic - go into a dungeon as a given class, slaughter monsters, level up, grab treasure, live as long as you can. It's for fun, fast, short-term play - though you may be surprised how long you may play it.  You pick a class, which has two different attack abilities, and wander across a randomly geneated field, battling monsters of many kinds by using your various abilities. The monsters themselves have different abilities, though most are cannon fodder - but watch out, some more powerful versions (who have titles or are different sizes) and special monsters may surprise you.  Monsters and various chests, jars, and barrels will drop treasure. Most of this is gold and healing and mana potions, but the occasional piece of equipment drops as well. The equipment often has little game-changing rules and additions that can make a different and require some thought. You may even find NPCs who join you - until the inevitable onslaughts kill them off.  Each level has a boss monster guarding a stairwell, which leads in turn to a REAL boss monster. Defeat these much more difficult opponents and you get a bonus to mana or health, a chance to buy random equipment, and then move on to the next level.  The game at first seems overly simple and overly hard, but rewards retrying. Classes are different - radically different. You can learn strategies for different enemies. Gold and scrolls (which can become gold) that you recover can unlock new classes and level up ones you already have. There's a lot to the game, its just often concealed beneath the frenzy and the randomness.  The game's biggest flaws are erratic difficulty and limited documentation - made more painful due to the randomness. It takes patience to get into it enough to really enjoy it. More polishing and documentation would definitely help.  Do I reccomend it? Like many games, the question is 'is it your thing.' It's not something everyone must play - it is something for people who like dungeon crawlers and action, and want a 'hardcore casual' game that's challenging, but can also be picked up and put down. In the latter case, Overture delivers. ",1,0
4459750,34330,Total War: SHOGUN 2,"What a great game this is. Grand scale 'empire management' 4X turn based campaign gaming set in medieval Japan's Sengoku Jidai period (mid 1500s), punctuated by real time Total War battles on land and sea that are lively and full of tactical challenge. Fantastic looks, grin-inducing ninja videos, historically accurate details, and a stellar soundtrack.  Definitely one of my top 5 games ever.",1,0

4467191,343360,Particula,"Got the game for when it was 40 cents or something. It is an okay game for that price, but full price is not worth. The idea and concept was nice and unique, but the gameplay was not as good. Tower defense games can be done in multiple ways, but they need a real challenge that requires real strategy. In this game, all you do is click little circles to build a defense tower. You can upgrade a tower's damage and speed.   The towers are not in danger of being destroyed, which isn't uncommon in tower defense games, but this game needs to make up for it in some other way to create a challenge beyond 'upgrade this structure, sell this tower for a more expensive tower, repeat' mindset.   If there were a variety of different enemies, such as aerial or something, it would be a bit different. However, it's just the same enemy, just has more health and bigger numbers of them over time.   I say yes when 90% off, but not full price. It's something most people will get bored of imediately, but I kinda like it. Unfortunately, my friend doesn't seem to so I wont play it ever again anyways.",-1,0

And secondly it's extremly well written, it goes into the depths of real life proffesional wrestling while keeping a layer of fiction (the insane shoots) just to keep the interest of those who don't really know much about wrestling. While maybe not as gritty as the movie 'The Wrestler' it can be heartwrenching at times even frustrating you feel like everything in the story is happening to you. It sucks you in and keeps you in until you realize it's 6 hours later and you just got one of the possible endings.

4478852,344760,Reign Of Kings,*** PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY***  I can give you all my bank account # so you can transfer the money to me instead of wasting it by buying this game.... This is esentially what you all will be doing if you buy this game except i'm not going to give you my account # rather you are just putting it in the dev's accounts and steams.  This IS NOT a game. This is basically a set of graphics that have been stitched together in some coherent manner. You can clearly see that if anyone had time to put into making this that they already planned not to finish it. This is what you would regard as a scam in terms of software. I played this game much more than it shows since i played it mostly at a friends place because he has a few computers setup there and we decided to bring out own and play altogether.   Please do yourself a favour and don't waste your money. You can feed a hungry person instead... There's nothing worse than a dev who is greedy and out to just make money using alpha state as an excuse for complete lack of anything resembling a game. In any normal situation this would be considered a scam and there would be criminal charges put on the dev. So if you want to give your money away for free then atleast give it to someone who is hungry on the street. Please i'm asking you as a personal favor to me... This game is by far by far by very far the worst game ever made or played. This is why it's blatantly obvious that the devs planned this from the start. I'm willing to bet anything on this. If the dev wants to dare let them come and answer the many questions we have. Obviously they are too scared to do it because of their sense of their guilt. Don't be part of this or you are equally to blame just like an accessory to the crime. I hope you can live with yourselves.,-1,0

4480809,344840,Gratuitous Space Battles 2,"UPDATE 04-07-15 : I wish to redact 'eye-watering' level of bugs - en lieu: 'massive congestive heart attack'...   I do love the ideas in this game, it's one of the few I have on my Mac, I spent hours designing ships, however I can ignore its terminal cancer no longer...  This game has so much potential, but it is like the grand ship rusting on the ocean floor for a ha'porth of tar...   The developer(s) have been so busy caught up in the far more creatively enjoyable process (for themselves as programmers and/or dreamers) of coming up with ideas for stuff to stick on deck: You know, metaphorical tennis courts, getting excited over the idea of having bubbles in the swimming pool...   ...they ignored the icky obligation of rolling their sleeves up, going down into the hold, dutifully confronting that trivial issue of seawater flowing into the hold. Who needs bouyancy when you've got a disco ball in the dining hall...!  This most recent update (1.35) has made this game *literally* unplayable, in the literal sense of course, that you cannot play this game because it's insta-crash...  In the history of horrific crashes, this game is reminiscent of the Challenger shuttle disaster. I say that of course, only because the ISS has yet to fall out of the sky onto a city full of children and puppies. If it did, I'd say it was more like that... (if it happened over and over...)...  I said to people before: It's going to be okay, they'll fix it. Hold off until then.  I think now however the: 'It's [you're] going to be okay' is sounding like Harvey Keitel in that bloody car scene in Reservoir Dogs...  ...  You'll not be pleased..   Old version:  There's a pretty eye-watering number of bugs if you're playing the Mac version of this, can't speak for the PC version. I only had it running for 30 seconds and in that time I discovered some of the graphical options disable the controls interface, the ship design starts producing transparencies when you duplicate items and there are some really odd resolution and framerate issues.  Hopefully it'll start getting patched however I think there's been some disregard as far as the Mac port - perhaps it was the rush to get finished. Hold off until it's patched - you can't sign onto stuff that's half-finished. The first game when I got it had the benefit of a number of fixes so hopefully it's just spending some time fixing stuff.",-1,1

I strongly recommend buying this game only when it is on sale and worth a few pence for you might feel robbed otherwise.  Coming to the game itself, this is possibly one of the best games when it was made and certainly a landmark in the Total War franchise. It is still a strong game and different enough from other Total Wars to be worth playing because it combines some of that realm and vassal management, giving it that extra realism that was lacking in later games and the battles are in awesome 2-D, graphics aside it all holds up very well.

At the time I'm writing this review I've gone through a little over 60 levels so far, which is way more than what I ever did with the old Windows version. The reason was running out of patience. Every single one has been terrible except for maybe the first few levels. This could be explained by the extremely short development time and the number of level being near to 150.  There is not much reason to get this beyond the nostalgia factor.  If you want actually challenging puzzles instead of monotonous mazes (there are a lot of them), get Chuck’s Challenge 3D instead.",-1,1

The vibrant dragonfly like illumination is contrasted by the subtle touch of shadows. Care and thought has gone into this masterwork.

I found the PC and NPC characters in the story to be interesting, distinct, and engaging.

4539424,348030,Trackday Manager,"Great idea but currently a broken game.  Avoid this game until the devs fix it, there is some actual working content and races are stable. If this were an early access game I'd be accepting but still disappointed. As a release title this simply isn't good enough and Steam ought to suspend sales until it is actually works.  I've held off posting my review to give the development team time to make the promissed updates. Despite the latest patch this game remains broken, full of bugs and unplayable. Features such as the 3 race cup series have been removed - apparently to create stability so there are currently only quick races available. If other human races are in the room - the whole point of this multiplayer game - races now freeze at the start.  The main problem is the instability of the game and frequent crashes at start or mid game. There are many other bugs but even getting to race is a lottery, actually racing with other humans is highly unlikely to work.  If you do manage to find a race and see it through to the finish there are a whole host of game breaking bugs which remain in the game:  - Worn tyres fitted to the player car at the start of races. - Dry tyres fitted to the player car for wet races - after selecting wet tyres from the pre race menu. - Race finishing positions are incorrect. - Race payouts either do not add up correctly or do not work at all. - AI performance is erratic, the AI can often perform impossible feats. - Incorrect race statistics - my race statistics say I have completed over 90 races at a track I have really raced on less than 10 times. - Achievements unlocking randomly without any reference to what happens in the game. - Random sound issues, the sound seems to become a mixed up drone by mid race.  Equally worrying is the fact the devs remove comments from the community hub. The removal of my feedback on a recent test is one of the reasons I have decided to post this review today. If the devs are now removing comments about the broken nature of the game this is unnaceptable.  There is a great basic game idea here but at this moment this game is broken and not release ready at all. I'll happily take a refund if the devs want to do the right thing!",-1,0

This is on ♥♥♥♥ing Steam, for Christ's sake.  Plus the game is oddly gory?

I thought I was dreaming for a second. Seriously, did NOT see that ♥♥♥♥ coming. Maybe I should have known from the title, but I thought the rats revenge would be something clean, like getting their tail in a mouse trap. I dunno, some other Tom and Jerry ♥♥♥♥. But I just ♥♥♥♥ing killed a cat by balancing a board on a box and barrel so a ball rolls to a mouse that hits it with a baseball bat so the ball goes flying into a safe that gets knocked off the edge. What the ♥♥♥♥ is this game and who thought it was necessary to make it.  Oh yeah and the game sucks ♥♥♥ to play too.

The weapons in this game take forever to kill a zombie and it would take from 5 to 20 hits with a melee weapon which is ridiculous.

4569644,351030,Pixel Puzzles Ultimate,"Life, as every other great teacher with sense of humor, mocks you along the way. It's not Life's fault - it's your own.  Being young, inexperienced and lacking knowledge about fundamentals of jigsaw puzzles, I thought putting together small pieces is as interesting as watching paint dry on the wall or slowly and painfully dying with morphine just out of reach. One day, who knows what rendition of digital jigsaw puzzles reintroduced me to concept and voila! here I am, playing and enjoying jigsaw games.  Latest installment in Decaying Logic's Pixel Puzzle series is Pixel Puzzles Ultimate, free-to-play title that doesn't radically differ from other PP titles, although it manages to fix certain problems I've encountered while playing Pixel Puzzles UndeadZ, game that I didn't like at all.  For starters, Pixel Puzzles Ultimate is not limited to certain theme. It allows players to put together different motifs ranging from animals (cats, dogs, reptiles...) to country motifs (Montana, Thailand, Japan, Korea...). Being free to play game, Pixel Puzzle Ultimate employs paid DLC content the expected way: you pay to unlock more themes. Puzzles are organized in theme packs and content varies from pack to pack - from one up to fifteen puzzles per pack. Unlike Microsoft Jigsaw, one of the most polished jigsaw puzzle experiences on PC unfortunately available only to Windows 8 and Windows 10 users, Pixel Puzzles Ultimate will not allow you to earn free puzzles simply by playing. This restricts puzzles behind paywalls and basic users are given three free sets and one complimentary DLC download. This means you will get 13 puzzles ranging from 112 to 1000 pieces which should suffice for several hours. Without paying a cent, you will be able to judge do you want to invest more money in the game.  First time you enter the game, you will be able to accommodate to game controls via short interactive tutorial that also allows you to setup your gaming experience. This includes limiting or turning off annoying floating pieces and customizing rotation and snap to grid options. Snap to grid allows your puzzles to be automatically placed down on board when in correct place and rotated correctly. It is VERY useful if you're running out of patience fast.   You are putting together your puzzles in different themes. Now, themes are pretty interesting concept and can be further customized, depending on a theme. Each consists of different graphic background, sounds and music. Music is definitely a great addition to Pixel Puzzle Ultimate. Each theme consists of several tracks and it's pity you can't mix themes and music - tracks are locked to themes and if you like tracks of one theme and graphic design of another, you will need to decide will you go easy on your eyes or ears.  It's pretty easy to master the PPU's control scheme. You can use mouse/mouse-keyboard combo or controller to move, rotate and place pieces. Pieces can be further categorized with the usage of drawers. Unfortunately, game doesn't allow selecting multiple pieces and moving them at the same time, which makes sorting a grueling task of drag and dropping. It's not that hard when you're working on 112 pieces puzzle, but imagine 1000 pieces. Yes. Drag and drop, all the way.   However, there are few crippling problems that PPU suffers from and these make time spent playing Pixel Puzzle Ultimate less enjoyable.  First of all, Decaying Logic stubbornly insists of strange patterns of puzzle pieces. What's known as traditional puzzle piece design is basically non-existent here and majority of puzzles are made of weird cutouts. This is not the first time Decaying Logic is promoting this contemporary approach to puzzling, it is well known from their other games. I get it, you want to modernize the game, but new isn't always the best, you know? While at one point players can get used to different patterns and use contemporary shapes to easily find missing pieces, players wanting more traditional approach may suffer from lack of enjoyment putting these puzzles together. Also, apparently due to limitations of their engine, puzzles are locked to pieces number. You like Horses DLC's puzzle? Well, get ready to lose your eyesight with 1000 pieces puzzle. No way you can learn about joys of puzzling or maybe introduce your kids to it by working on 50 pieces horses picture. I know, I know, real life puzzles couldn't change number of pieces, but it's 2016 and we're talking digital, and digital should allow us to abolish certain limitations.  Most people know that putting huge puzzles together requires you to (usually) connect bordering pieces, then categorize pieces according to their colors and then build different sections that you later put together. I simply can't understand why PPU doesn't allow players to snap different pieces together outside of main game area. Yes, this means you will not be able to connect pieces that go together and save them for later. This makes sessions so much more exhausting.  Zooming in should help us deal with puzzles more easily. Unfortunately, due to Decaying Logic's implementation of low quality pictures, zooming in only brings another set of problems. If you're working on puzzles with more than 300 pieces, you will need to zoom in to check some details. However, upon zooming in, picture becomes truly blurry. Eyesore causes eyeache and this is the primary reason why I don't recommend anyone with any kind of eye problems and/or headaches caused by straining your eyesight working on anything bigger than 300 pieces and only in session of one hour or so. Puzzle preview can't be zoomed in separately, so using the integrated zoom in question accomplishes nothing.   Low quality pictures aren't the only problem concerning graphics. Beside unintuitive UI that makes puzzle area feel cramped, most packs are bringing boring motifs that don't really get you excited about spending your time hunting for miniature pieces. If you can, try Microsoft Jigsaw and see their packs. Or try mobile jigsaw aps by Kristanix Games and Bandagames and witness the excitement of putting together beautiful photographies. See their cats packs and then come here and see what PPU is offering. PPU' packs seem lazy, lacking quality control and I firmly believe they would make their BEST PACK ever by only asking amateur photographers to submit their photos. Yes, that's how average their packs are.  Here's the first time that I'm aching from the fact we don't have Not Sure recommendation button on Steam. Truth be told, I'm more on red than blue thumb button (no, this is not Trump reference). It seems we only get P2W and badly ported mobile games here on Steam lately and I pray to all the cosmos forces to see Microsoft Jigsaw or similar good mobile game here on Steam. Putting the pieces together should be fun, mind engaging and relaxing experience; however, due to bunch of problems (majority of packs locked behind paywall, low quality photographs, lack of advanced control options and any kind of customization), Pixel Puzzle Ultimate leaves a lot to be desired.   However, due to the fact it's free and it will provide you with few hours of fun with its 13 free (and who knows how many more at some point) puzzles, unless you can't stand weird patterns, I am rating it positively. But if Decaying Logic continues being stuborn and doesn't allow players more freedom, both in controlling options, gameplay experience and free content, the first sign of another puzzle game with different motifs and traditional approach and I'm outta here.   ***  Hey, you've liked this review?

The game still looks great, is very expansive with lots of secrets to discover and challenges to conquer, and a story that involves a good amount of Batman's Rogue Gallery without them feeling tacked on. Although the combat forces you to be more tactical due to it demanding more precise button presses, and thus, making the gameplay a little slower, it still holds up to this day.

4576871,35140,Batman: Arkham Asylum GOTY Edition,"It took a long time for me to jump into the Arkham series, even though alot of friends has recommended the series to me like crazy. The biggest reason for not listening to them initially, was because I was very unfamiliar with the Batman-universe. Therefore, it was a positive surprize to me when I discovered that Arkham Asylum does a great job with integrating new players to the Batman-universe. I loved the characters, the story, and the ethical dillemmas surrounding the establishment of a facility such as the Arkham Asylum and Batman's 'no killing' rule.  Gameplay-wise, the game was INSANELY enjoyable. Since guns are a no-go for Batman, silent takedowns or hand-to-hand combat (with a scent of gadgets) is the way to go. Both are very-well done and innovative, and other good open-world games published after Asylum has clearly grabbed a few ideas from the game's combat and sneaking system.  One thing I remember especially well from the game is the Arkham Asylum itself. The level design (both estethics and technically) is impressive, and I love how the Asylum alters as the game progresses.   Writing this review a few months after having played it, I all of a sudden want to play it again. 10/10",1,0
4578202,35140,Batman: Arkham Asylum GOTY Edition,So how do I sum this game up.....HOLY F***ING S***! This is the only game I have played through where everything is damn near perfect! The game play flows from stealth action leaping form the shadows to strike down criminals to the school of advanced kickassery that only the bat would be able to dish out. The game begins with you The Bat escorting The Joker voiced my Mark f*** mothering Hamill toArkham Asylum where after a brief cutscene in which Killer Croc says he's gonna kill you (because he's a big green mofo and will s*** on your couch if he feels like it) the Joker breaks free and quickly tells you that it was all part of his master plan to be taken here tonight and while you may think that would make a weak begining to a weak story you would be wrong! The story was actually the creation of Paul Dini (aka the lord and master of the 90's Batman cartoon) who has not lost his edge in all these years. I am running out of lines so 10/10 Riddler riddles make me laugh and Harley = HOT,1,0
4578292,35140,Batman: Arkham Asylum GOTY Edition,"Most superhero games have fluctuated in quality for the most part, from the horrible, to the somewhat enjoyable quality.   While Batman games have had a far more generous treatment than Superman's (Superman 64 anyone?) one can hardly say that these games have ever been as amazing as they should be.  Well, up until Batman: Arkham Asylum. Yes, finally. This game not only portrays the Batman universe accurately and with detail, it does the one most important thing. It makes us feel like the Batman. Everything about this game screams high quality. From the detailed menus, to the flawless fun combat, it remains true to Batman and gives the genre the epicness it deserves.  Let's begin. Arkham Asylum basically starts with you, the Batman, apprehending the Joker and taking him into custody into this facility dedicated to rehabilitating psychos, which Gotham is home to many. However, the Joker had a plan up its sleeve, and you'll have to stop him before he, his henchmen, and many other villains from wreaking havoc upon Gotham. The plot may be pretty standard, but it's excellently done.   The voice acting is phenomenal, as is the immersive scenes you'll come across. The villains themselves are many, some with their own hidden agenda, some well known such as Harley Quinn, the Joker, or Poison Ivy, to some more obscure ones reserved for avid fans. It's great to see them all so accurately portrayed, given how diverse Batman's opponents are throughout his long history of crimefighting.  The Asylum itself is actually pretty big. Beyond the various facilities, the entire island is available for you to explore, albeit sections of it may be closed off either for plot purposes, or because you're missing a certain gadget or skill in order to be able to reach them. This, combined with the rather closed and linear feel of the game overall, gives it a pretty big Castlevania vibe. You'll notice areas wondering how to get to, until you get that one gadget and then it just clicks with your brain, allowing you to get there.  But is the exploration worth it? Yes, yes it is. The game rewards you lavishly for exploration, as all games should. The main part of the collectibles make sense in the Batman lore, as it turns out the Riddler himself has planted them all over the Asylum, and as his namesake demands, also placed riddles for you to solve. He will start out sarcastically complimenting you as you solve the first ones, gradually becoming nervous and afraid you'll solve them all as you progress further. It's great fun just hearing his reactions couples with juicy collectibles, like optional challenges, character biographies providing detailed insight into each character in the Batman mythos. Other collectibles include recording tapes from interviews made by the medical personnel to certain villains, letting you know just a bit more about them.  This is all fine and good, but I could not end this review without talking about the strongest point of this game, its phenomenal gameplay. It plays so well on the PC it's unreal. Kicking groups of thugs, dodging about, sneaking up on them and taking them out. The AI's great, they'll actually freak out if you're good and take them out one at a time.   It feels like you're the Batman, I can't stress this enough. And that's exactly what these games should be about. Can't wait to get my hands on Arkham City. Arkham Asylum is a must play, and even if you don't care about Batman, you'll end up loving it.",1,0

Play the game for yourself, you'll get a more open-minded and undilluted opinion of it that way.  Dev guy is a cute, small game about a developer who forget his flash drive (containing his unreleased game on it) in his car and so he must set out ot reclaim it.  Took me as long as it did to beat it but I had alot of fun. It was funny, silly and even slightly a bit dark at one point where you literally commit a B&amp;E.  It's not as long as other games, but for however short it is, it left a wonderful impression on me.  It's got minigames which a couple of them have awful controls, only they actually work for the context so they actually enhance the experience.  That's why this game gets a 10/10. I can't find anything actually wrong with this game that actually does fit in with the game's contexts, and the Jiggly mode made me laugh for a full three minutes straight.  Just play it.

4587454,351970,Tales of Zestiria,"my third tales game after Symphonia (on gamecube and ps3) and Vesparia. I may not be the most hardcore tales fan, only playing through it on the default difficulty and found that i only died if i was making big mistakes on how to approch the battle.  I found the story to be good but very slow to pick yp steam (like 6-8 hours) and it kept on picking up steam for the rest of the game, never stalling. Graphically it is very impressive for the hardware demands, make sure you have Vsync on though otherwise you may puke. I never used the KBM and opted to use a Xbox one controller instead and everything worked fine, all actions were rebindable on the pad (i switched A and B around) and found it played very well  Some negatives of the game have to be the plot holes that, while they don't change the story much, are a huge oversight and could be explained away with questionable assumtions. The game uses the immeiate area around you for battles so if you run into something in a door way or while near a cliff, the camera can get wonky trying to place itself between the object and your charecter. The Fusion system for items i found was overcomplicated and needed use of external reading to even try to understand, i ignored it for the most part. just fusing items of the same name together for increased stats and managed fine.  overall i would say this is a good game if you are a tales fan, not the best, not the worst. If you are new i would suggest waiting for Symphonia's port if you want to play on PC, or playing one of the older titles to get into the seris.  i would rate the game a 8/10",1,0

4588701,351970,Tales of Zestiria,"Bugs make this game unplayable. Avoid until fixed.  Edit&gt; Clarity  Since installing this game I've gone through several iterations of it not working. I (very fortunately) have not experienced the graphical glitches experienced by the majority of people reporting bugs. I have, however, experienced keys randomly becoming unbound or rebound in weird ways (the escape key suddenly being swapped with the functionality of the space (help) key, the 'cancel' button becoming unbound no matter where it was rebound to). Stuck save files. My issue isn't that there are specific issues with the game that have no fixes (although there are) it's that everyone seems to be having different issues with the game that cause it to break. The developers are very understanding and say they're working on these issues and stability, and I believe them. They released an emergency patch which some people claim saved their game within hours, but the fact is many games are still broken.  Because of the technical issues I'm having, I am probably not as far along as most people who are playing, but I get a slight sense of disappointment from the battle system and the lack of real sidequests. I wish the developers had put a little more time into optimizing battles for the PC. Support talents other than 'prepare snack' are largely useless, and unfortunately some are necessary for forwarding the plot in ways that aren't immediately obvious.   On the flip side, the parts of the game I have been able to play (and replay, because the save system isn't so great) are very nice. They really take the classic Tales series storytelling to a new level and give fans some of that cross nostalgia. The battle system (despite my objections) is very visually smooth and pretty. They revamped the Arte system, so don't look for the same spells that have been used since before Symphonia, you probably won't find them. The cut-in final moves are pretty and unique, and you really get a sense of the character from them.   I'll probably change my recommendation in the next few patches. In the meantime, if you're thinking about buying, hold off and save yourself some headache.  FINAL EDIT&gt; It's official. I am unable to play this game anymore. I thought it was just me being grumpy about it's construction, but I am literally too bored of it to beat the final level. Sorry guys, this one is a major bust for me.

The hud is extremely confusing unless you pay close attention  and die so many times in demolition . Demolion mode has some quirks to work out with the A.I. but otherwise generally decent.  Now this is personal gripe so take it with a grain of salt, I like customizing my cars....alot. From moving the decals to upgrading pistons in the engine. This game just gives you paint job with no choice in decals whatsoever. However, you can upgrade yur car's weapons which is decent....  It's not.

And even then, there may be the case your car is slow enough  to be overtaken by a snail  that the other car can leave you in  in it's dust  blood and zombie infested wake.  All in all the game itself had potential, and it could have used some major developing before being turned loose, but the mediocre customization, confusing as hell story, and difficulty of getting something better than that clunker you get at the start almost make this game dead in the water.  4/10 'The Diamond in the Rough zombie driver.'",-1,0

4600947,353700,The Deadly Tower of Monsters,"Unless you grew up watching movies like Clash of the Titans, 20 Million Miles to Earth, The 7th Voyage of Sinbad, Jason and the Argonauts and any other number of Ray Harryhausen or Harryhausen-esque pictures, you'll really be missing the point of  The Deadly Tower of Monsters  which would be a shame; strip away the B-movie aesthetics of the game and you're left with a mostly unremarkable but mindlessly enjoyable top-down beat-em-up that pits you against everything from evil apes to flying saucers to giant ants.  With that said, I can't overstate how brilliantly that low-budget sci-fi influence is realised. The scenery looks cobbled together from cheap rubber and styrofoam. Enemies are either obviously stuntmen in suits or stop-motion effects. Many times, you can see the strings holding them up or the boom mic appearing in cutscenes. The plot is authentically nonsensical. Every facet of the aged Hollywood magic that made those films what they were is present, correct and jammed full of obscure references and Easter eggs; rarely has a game shown so much devotion and love to its subject matter.  Not quite as endearing, however, is the commentary track that runs throughout the playtime.  TDTOM  is presented as a DVD re-release with the director and his production assistant firing out quips every thirty seconds or so and while it's been exhaustively written and is fairly humorous on occasion, there is just far too much of it. A lot of times, the two voices will be jabbering on, fully subtitled, while you're trying to hack your way through a major battle or set-piece so you wind up missing what they're saying by way of trying to concentrate on not getting crushed by a plasticine brontosaur.  There's a metric arseload of weapons to grab as you go, some far more useful than others, which can be upgraded with cogs that you find as you progress. Annoyingly, your loadout only allows for two ranged and two melee weapons at a time which wouldn't be a huge deal if the game didn't force you to find a terminal every time you wanted to change them. The worst part about this setup is that every time you pick up a new weapon, one of your current ones gets elbowed out of your inventory. Having fun with your ultra-powerful Tesla cannon? Not any more! Have this crappy flamethrower instead! Even better, have it while you're being literally SWARMED by waves of killer ants!   The character stat upgrade system is more pleasing and innovative. You're not rewarded with skill points by way of XP; rather, the game has you complete various objectives, many of which are completely optional. While you'll usually get one for killing a boss, taking down a giant dinosaur with a knife is all on you. It adds depth to a game that is, at times, lumbered with mechanics that sorely need it.  Still,  TDTOM  has more than enough style and bare bones playability to be worth a try, especially for fans of the genre it inhabits. It's a forgivingly easy game; you can make it through without a good deal of the upgrades available but as a love letter to those creaky, weird and wonderful pictures that entranced me as a kid, you'll find none better.

4601580,354140,Five Nights at Freddy's 3,"I highly recommend this game. Not because I'm a big fan, but During my time playing it, it really hits home.  First of all, the game is very different from the previous two. There is only one animatronic. Now you may think that is easy. Come on, like only one? While this is technically true, there are the other animatronics (in the form of hallucinations), like I've seen Foxy, Chica, BB, etc., that act as distractions by jumpscaring you, so that mister new guy can say hello.  Second of all, the new defense system isn't very obvious, which I like. There are two main defenses (at least I think), which is the audio system (consisting of BB's HI's HELLO's and HAHAHA's) , and the ventellation grates. The audio is used to lure the new guy away from you and the ventellation is used to block certain vents so he can't crawl through them, one of these leading straight to your office, which can allow for some new strategies on how to survive the nights.  Third of all, is the atmosphere. I never feel safe when I play this game, dreading that something will be jumping in my face. In the game, there is a big wide window in front of you, in which is implemented greatly, as sometimes you can see Freddy limping to your door, to the new guy staring at you, then dashing away, even to him peaking at you while trying to stay hidden. It reflects the game's mood, which is what I like the most.  In general, I believe that this game is the creepiest game in the trilogy, offering new scares, more stress for you to get over, and new secrets to discover.  P.S: Things that I look forward to; - Golden Freddy (if he exists) - The Custom Night (1/20 or more...)   Update: I've done some research, and I think I can confirm that   there is no custom night which makes sense (you only got SpringTrap really) but thats fine as there are a lot of secrets that makes me keep searching for them.   Also I don't know if Golden Freddy exists or not.  Anyway, thanks for the comments!   Another Update: Golden Freddy does exist in this game. Just search it up on youtube!",1,1
4601629,354140,Five Nights at Freddy's 3,"FNaF 3 is actually my favorite one out of the 4 main games. It's a lot easier then the other ones, and really not that scary, but at this point that's not what it's about. Since FNaF2 that's not what the series is about. Obviously people like Markiplier, and ugh, PewDiePie, are infamous players of the series, and have quite a loud mouth about it too.   But believe me, it's more than gameplay, it's a story. Each game was meant to be another part of the story. Now for my speculation, 3 is the end of the timeline.   1. Kids souls are set free 2. The still mysterious 'purple guy' meets his doom  tl;dr FNaF isn't so much about the gameplay as much as it was in the first 2, but more the story in between it all",1,1

Now I can understand how people can put this as a negative for it just being a simple puzzle game where you don't really do anything but click stuff for $4.99 but I think it is totally worth it. DON'T LOOK UP WALKTHROUGHS OR STUFF LIKE THAT FOR THE GAME OR ELSE ITS RUINED. The game would be pointless! If you can't play the game for what it is, (a really challenging puzzle game) then whats the point of playing it. You will get no enjoyment from it because the only enoyment is from the giant feeling of success from solving a really tricky puzzle. The art style is pretty cool with the game being humorous and hard at the same time for the endings. If you still think the game is too short after beating all the puzzles legit then try to get all the achievments. They will extend the life of the game and are pretty rewarding.

Then, I started to play as a Soviet, and things were STILL interesting -   -Listened to an amazingly voiced speach from the game and a high-ranking member of our team -Ran out of spawn with everyone screaming 'HURRA!' -Was gunned down in a hail of German bullets -Then went into a new game that had just as good of a start -Started losing but still held on as the General kept saying that we can win -Heard a German officer go on the megaphone who gave a huge speach of how there is no need for more bloodshed between the Soviets and them -Lisened to the teammates who were like 'The f#%@ is this guy on about?' -Came back with a HUGE amount of 'HURRA!' -Defeated the Germans and started to win the war  I haven't really played much as the Germans or the Americans, but the game is FANTASTIC. 11/10 would suicide/banzai/listen-to-megaphone again",1,0

4623097,355520,The Albino Hunter™ (Original),"First of all I have to say that I am a huge fan of RPG-Maker Games so that might influenced my opinion about this game.  The Albino Hunter is a really nice made RPG with lots of humor, but therefor not many serious parts to help with characterevolution (for example). The story does not follow a liniar line like msot RPGs. In most RPGs you know who is the bad guy/girl and you spend the whole story chasing her/him. Here you are a hunter just looking for jobs which is really a nice change of pace.  Pros: - good amount of humor - interisting way of story-telling - areas previously visited can(should) be explored again when the stroy progresses - no need for excessive grinding  Cons: - battles are not really challenging - some of the mentioned humor are references to other works of the developers, if you don't know these works they seem missplaced sometimes  so all in all I would recommend it to everyone who want to play a none serious RPG to train your laughmuscles ;)",1,0

4623462,355800,Space Run Galaxy,"I am a big fan of this game. It ticks all of my 'addictive enjoyment' buttons... bathroom breaks are about all I made time for during the first couple of days play. I imagine my compulsive playing will simmer down to an hour here and there in future... and my personal hygeine may recover.  This game is a hex based ship building game where the preservation of your ship, your defences and your cargo is the goal (some similarity to the board game Galaxy trucker). The ship layout is followed by cargo placement, and subsequent tower defence elements requiring you to stave of waves of asteroids, enemies and creatures all trying to beat you up for your tasty tasty random ♥♥♥♥.   Things I love:   Designing and optimising your ship layout   Unlocking new weapons, defences and modules and gradually incorporating them into your strategy and (ever larger) ships   Good difficulty curve – harder enemies and harder cargo introduced at a decent pace   Reactive gameplay – there is some randomisation in missions which mean you need to focus your structures where the attacks come from (primarily two directions)   Failing a mission is not the end of the world. You never lose material resources, you just receive a smaller reward and may have to perform the run again   Allows for short session play. A mission can be paused and lasts 5-10 minutes (really hard ones you repeatedly fail can take quite a lot longer)   There is an in-game story. Nothing amazing but should make you smirk.   Things I think some people will dislike:   Repetitive gameplay: So far I've been enjoying myself and the slowly increasing difficulty but it could become grindy.   Partial randomisation: This can make some missions and ship configurations very hard to beat. If you get a wave you can't deal with in the first 30 seconds you can (and probably should) start again - but being able to adapt to everything thrown at you is the aim (or upgrade/redesign your ship).   Destroyed by a hard enemy (just before you finish the mission): I don't mind this as i enjoy learning, rethinking and eventually winning – however the first couple of times you're completely destroyed by some random nasty do cause some unfettered swearing.   Forgetfulness: Sometimes you're destroyed simply because you forgot to reconfigure a particular weapon – however the provided in-game information on upcoming waves is very clear so it's all down to you (and how overwhelmed you are).   Things I dislike:   Building the wrong module (can happen a lot if you press the wrong key combination in your haste) means you use up the limited supply as well as resources to build. if there was a 5-10 second window where you could reclaim the erroneously built module it would prevent a lot of mission restarts.   Clicking on a module to activate the special ability brings up windows that block your view of the ship. This can make targeting and watching health bars difficult.   Missions occasionally crash after completion – I chalk this up to new game teething problems. Still happens occasionally.   Being unable to target a particular area on a ship. The auto targeting is mostly pretty good – for small one-hit-kill mobs your weapons will alternate targets to avoid wastage. Unfortunately for larger vessels you weapons may target irrelevant parts which you can't prevent. The ability to assign a priority target by clicking (should you wish to) it would alleviate this gripe.   I formed my   addiction   opinions during the pre-release and at that time had no issues playing. There are still occasional problems with the online version, but they are infrequent and the multiplayer world does add to the game. (there is an offline mode)  TLDR:   Awesome game   Hugely addictive (and fun)   You'll have to put up with a few problems with the online game, but they are mostly fixed and will only improve with the attention the devs are giving it.

The difficulty jumps up and down, rather than ramping up each level, but finishing a puzzle is generally rewarding and failure feels mostly fair.  It's a weird game. The story is awful beyond belief, predictable, and involves murdering hundreds of innocent party-goers. But it does have interesting mechanics and good puzzle design, that makes me want to recommend it.

4649950,358090,D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die,"I won't reccomend this game for the gameplay, the game was originally intended to be played on Xbox One with a Kinect and even though the port is okeish you'll be using the mouse to mostly observe, interact with characters in dialogues and with some fun little quick time event action sequences from time to time (plus one pointless minigame).  What you should really be buying this game for is the story. I don't want to go into too much detail to avoid spoilers, but it's basically about a detective solving a mistery with time travel involded (though be warned by the big - Season One - in the title, the game is episodic and it ends with a   ♥♥♥♥ing cliffhanger  ) and it's   really good  . It has both comedic and dramatic moments but it seems to mostly be going in a very bizarre and random direction which I would not know how to define well except that is amazingly entertaining in an over the top and trashy way.  One last thing: Even though I really enjoyed this I think the full price (15€) is a bit too high, especially considering how short the game is, I advice to wait for a discount.",1,0

Anytime I only have a few minutes to play, I get on my PC or tablet and work out a strategy to keep those hungry zombies from my plants and ultimately my brains. With the addition of entertainingly varied minigames in the GOTY edition, PvZ manages to keep me entertained despite having finished adventure mode many, many times. Adorably cartoony graphics and a soundtrack with a multitude of earworm-y tunes add to the joy of playing. One of my favorites.",1,0
4656233,359230,Lethis - Path of Progress,"Overall I love this game, however, I can't recommend it in its current state. Every time I start playing a new level I experience at least one crash to desktop. The last city I spent two hours creating now crashes to desktop every 2-5 minutes after reloading, I can't progress and need to restart my city, however, I'm not confident the new one I create won't experience the same problem.   For such a small game it takes forever to load on my SSD, I don't understand why the load times are so gargantuan.  I've also experienced buildings just randomly collasping. Apparently this should only happen if they're not being serviced or if homes aren't near a well, however, I've seen homes that were between a well and service building collapse, resulting in the entire level 10 block downgrading to level 1 or collasping as well, at which point you need to shut down your entire industry and slowly turn buildings on as the population recovers.   It's a fun, charming game, however, long load times, frequent crashes to desktop and random buildings collapsing just sucks the life out of the game. If these problems are patched out I would highly recommend the game, but in its current state it's too frustrating to play through.",-1,1
4657055,359310,Evoland 2,"The game takes you on a journey through the history of gaming and does a great job of it.  Most of the game is played as a zelda-like action RPG, but the game often switch game-types in dungeons.  Almost all of the game-types are worked out really well. Although it's often a bit simplified, the developers made sure to add some mechanics that keeps the different game-types interesting. The difficulty (I was playing on hard) felt really good, it was challenging but never frustratingly hard. The storyline is really good, it takes about 20 hours to complete the story and after that there are still a lot of collectables to be found.  Another thing I really liked about the game is the sense of humor, there are a lot of funny references to other games.  All in all I would give this game a 8 out of 10 and would recommend it to anyone who has been playing videogames since the NES/SNES/PS era.",1,0

Three core paths to reach elite status in, factions to gain rank with, and now Powerplay on top of that. Plenty of ships to fly with more being added.

I'm about 46 hours in and every time i stop playing I get an itch to start again, It would be great if they added a guild system where you can join other players (who aren't your friends) with ease and work together in game to shape the Galaxy in a larger way. I have high hopes that the developer will keep adding different elements to the game to help keep people interested.

Very limited and very punishing gameplay with little rewards.   ♥♥♥♥ peer pressure, ♥♥♥♥ this game.    What has kept me from uninstalling? One single aspect of the game: Exploration  I went through the tedious and joyless process of following a rare goods trade route I had found on the interweb until I could afford an Asp Explorer with appropriate equipment (about 15Mill, for the curious). That took me a couple of days but since I really wanted to try exploration I endured it.  I tried mining too but the credits are horrible compared to rare good trading unless you game the mission system by constantly logging between multiplayer and singleplayer to generate new random missions until you get the mining missions you need. Again, tedious and joyless are the best descriptors.  Then another boring and mindless two day grind to get into the system where I wanted to buy the discounted exploration ship.  But then I had my ship and I started exploring. Mind you, the whole exploration system is quite barebone and some aspects like e.g. selling your exploration data are just bad. The game can't even manage a list of the heavenly bodies you've discovered first, wtf!  BUT the actual moment of exploration, when you find your first neutron star or when you see the freaky things a black hole does to light or....or....or...ITS ♥♥♥♥ING MAJESTIC.  So I still think the game is mostly scheisse and many aspects of it are almost offensively bad. Especially the beginning of the game! If you enjoy exploration though and dont mind grinding for a week to be allowed to do so, this game can be great!  p.s. Don't expect the game to explain anything meaningful to you. The devs were super lazy in that regard. You need to rely on community sources to make informed decisions about ships and modules.",-1,1

Like reaching your friends in the same system or simply traveling to a station. I'm not saying it is impossible, just overcomplicated for no valid reason.  Traveling within a system is long and boring and sometimes you get 'hacked' without a chance to escape. I got hacked and failed to resist in about half a second. The HUD barely had time to show the red/blue lines.  The combat missions are very cryptic. I mean, how hard can it be to give me clear targets? Instead the game says ' kill 4 traders within system X' and you have no confirmation that the ship you are looking at is your actual target. You just have to hope the guy you are shooting at IS your target.

4673631,359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,"At the time of writing I am clearance level 130, ranked Diamond with 2.6 Win/Loss(ranked) and 2.1 Kill/Death(ranked).  Ranked matchmaking is literally cancer at the moment, with bottom tier ranked teams getting matched against top tier ranked teams, and once you reach platinum+ get ready to face hackers every time you play. Players with ping roughly 40ms+ higher than yours get an advantage and are able to go around corners and shoot before the lower ping player sees their player model even appear; this also means you can be killed by their shots after you've already taken cover (around a corner/behind a bulletproof object/out of LoS(Line of Sight). There are plenty of matchmaking errors still present in the game and it can be difficult to get into a game when searching with a group as the chance for an error is even greater.  Despite these issues, the gameplay is solid, the maps are well designed taking full advantage of the destructable environments, different classes allow totally different styles of play and tactics. Apart from some shotguns, weapons are fairly well balanced. The sound design is fantastic and provides just as much information as spotting players on cameras, as with decent headphones and map knowledge you can pinpoint character positions and even what the enemy is doing (planting charges/using a shield/crawling/using their drone or camera). When you have a group of 5 who communicate, the options for amazing tactical teamplay suddenly open up and you are only limited by what tactics you can come up with.  Although Siege is pushing to be an esports fps with ESL and Go4R6, and ESL at least have competent anti-cheat in place, the game isn't quite ready for that, but that doesn't mean you can't have a hell of a good time playing the game, be it in casual or taking your chances in ranked.",1,0

4684617,359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,"Looking for a game that's competitive and doesn't have many bugs? Well this isn't the game for you.   Firstly, the game's servers currently run on 15 tick. For people who know what it is that's enough to know its horrible. If you dont know, 15 tick means the server reads and sends out data for player movement, shots and other actions 15 times a second. The minimum for games that want to be competitive is 64, and for high skill competitive tournaments it is usually 128.  Secondly, the game is plauged with bugs, body parts can clip through walls, your body is not correctly shown (you can see your legs are not in front of you, but to other people they are), The in-game sound can stop completely until the next round starts, you can get stuck in objects, and drones often fall through the map.  Thirdly, and this may be because of the 15 tick servers, but movement and combat feels extrememly floaty and CODlike, the hitboxes are terrible, and often you are being killed when you are already around a corner. The guns all feel like they are just the same gun with different skins.  I've alerady requested a refund, if they fix most of the bugs and the terrible 15 tick servers, I may rebuy. But if you were interested in this as a competitive game, don't buy it.  Edit: While the 15 tick rate is unconfirmed it is very obvious from playing the game it is not high enough and the claims it was 15 were believable for me, as in-game you hear 1 shot but in the kill cam's damage log it shows as 5. And as for refunds they are done on a case per case basis so there is not a 0% chance I won't get my money back.",-1,1
4685381,359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,"After putting in a good amount of time into this games multiplayer, I've grown to really like it when everything is working correctly.

If you enjoy getting killed after taking cover this is the game for you, and if you enjoy getting shot in the head when their cross hair is nowhere near you, this is the game for you.   Also, for some reason the game likes to smash everyone into the game regardless of region even if you have the option to only match with people from the same region as you. So a lot of the time depending on the time of day, you get put against people who have 200-400 ping which is completely unacceptable.  I know the rank system is in beta but I shouldn't get matched against people in ranked who are level 100+ while I'm trying to place in a rank when i'm only level 40. I get that it's supposed to place you based on skill and obviously someone who is lvl 100+ who has never played ranked before is going to smash me, but thats like me being bronze, trying to move up and then getting put against gold players, it's just not fair.

4686618,359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,"Okay, I brought this game due to my love of the 'Rainbow Six' series I used to own all the games on my old xbox so I thought why not buy there new one on PC. What could possibly be bad? Well a lot to be real.  Cons -   Matchmaking servers - The servers are slow and are more cared for than notts county. You spend 5-10 minutes queuing for a game only for someone to leave being thrown back into the pool to wait another 10 minutes. When you finally make it into a game you are sat waiting for someone to load into the game (this can happen to anyone good connection or bad) just a connection icon appears next to the name and there is nothing you can do. This usually takes anywhere from 1-10 minutes to fix and can happen after any round of the game.  Ubisoft E3 v Reality - The E3 kings as they should be known as. Once again they hyped a game up and showed great graphics and gameplay during the E3 conference only for when the game to be released all of this is removed and the game looks like a potato.  Content - Once again another game that has been released with lack of content, I got so sick of playing the same maps everytime which are just boring houses and plane thrown in. But DLC are here so you can waste more money buying more crap that isn't worth the price. Sad to see so many games now days being released with so little content which is needed to be paid for to be able to use. You can unlock some of these features in game with the currency you get, but this amount is so little, I have played around 30 hours now and only unlocked one of the high tier operators if I wanted to get all 6 I need to play close to 180+ more hours. (Hard to get for a game with a lack of content)  Game modes - The online games run quite smooth apart from the constant stop to choose an operator after each round, then waiting for someone to reconnect to the servers. The MAIN downfall is the terrorist hunt. Holy ♥♥♥♥ is this bad, Vegas 2 set a good example of what it should be like and it was great, but this game completely misses the mark.  1, I can't choose what map I would like to play on when playing a terrorist hunt game mode. 2, I can't choose if I want to defend or attack so I'm constantly exiting and rejoining just to play a certain map/ attack, defend.  3, WHY NO CO-OP?!?!?! I just want to have a laugh with my mate challenging our selves on different difficulty but noooooo.... I have to play with 2 other idiots who don't speak my language instead of queuing separately as a 2. Kill me. Please.  Pros -   The main game play - The competitive side of the game is fun, minus all the pauses and re picks that slow the gameplay down. I like the concept of scanning out the objective before going in. This adds a new tactical side to the game that not many games have done.  Team work - This game requires a lot of team work which can be fun when playing with a group of friends. Everyone online is usually quite nice and the people who play the game aren't immature yet I have come across a few who use the 'Mom' insult a lot but a swift insult to there country about how ours is better than there's shuts them up.  Concept - The games concept is great and the combat during the game works greatly but sadly the game is made by ubisoft.  All in all it's an okay game but brought down by so many areas, ubisoft once again showing great creativity but poorly executing it just like Nottingham forest defence. All they needed to do was make the game flow better, remove all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in game purchases, fix the terrorist hunt and make it work, remove the whole operator and add custom classes that you can choose what items they use (just like the good old days is Vegas 2 (creating a custom character for the terrorist hunt map etc)).  Just don't buy it, it's not worth it, even for a £10. I would rather spend that money on a KFC boneless banquet and catch the bus back home.",-1,0

Here's what is now standard business practice for games publishers like ubisoft and EA and all the other craptastic games publishers.  Step 1: Hype up their 'game' with lots of highly scripted and suspicious looking 'gameplay' trailers  Step 2: Hire big name actors or well known public figures to talk about the game who have no ♥♥♥♥ing clue about the product to read it from a script or outright make up utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t about it that makes no sense to the actual game, for some reason this particularly irks me because it seems like they haven't even tried playing the game properly for five minutes  Step 3: Give pre-orders and a release date en masse to generate even more hype, offer up exclusive usually game breaking content for people who pre-order the game or alternatively, offer up something that has no ♥♥♥♥ing worth whatsoever ( Usually some sort of skin for a gun or outfit for a character ) and tack on £10 or so to the original base price  Step 4: Release the game, people play it only to discover that there is far less content than what was promised, outrage will soon follow so either go quiet and never respond to any emails hoping the outraged gamers will go away. Or issue a grovelling apology and talk about how they made mistakes and will try to fix it all.  Step 5: Ignore the gamers in either previous scenarios  Step 6: Start releasing DLC content that was prepared before games release and what the developers really worked on, usually the DLC can be most charitably described as what I call 'content unlockers' as the data is already there and they have the models prepared but they want to charge the price of a full independent game for you to unlock it. These DLC come with all sorts of new problems that didn't really exist in the days fo expansion packs ( Which are like 7 DLCs combined or even a nearly seperate game for those who don't remember or were too young ) things like maps which segregate online communities because the people who refuse to pay for them won't get to play them and as mentioned before offering up overpowered weaponry etc. which further break the game especially if it's in multiplayer.  Step 7: Profit  Step 8: Make absolutely no changes after several months, ignoring any complaints made by gamers and move onto the next game, then repeat the process all over again.   I admit, I am rather rage downvoting this because I was stupid enough to let the game go over the 7 hour game time limit for steam refunds however when you consider how much this game costs and how much it is supposed to be offering even without the technical issues it really is a damn rip off. Games publishers need to be stopped from doing this and I think as of now I will actively boycott games publishers like this who think they can just release games for this amount of money and then force people to buy DLCs at ridiculous prices if they want to get any new content.  Yes, the gameplay they have shown us isn't bad, the destruction is actually quite good, however as an overall game, I am not impressed by it, I suggest everyone should go and buy this other little mentioned game called 'Due Process' when it opens up for early access. It is being developed by indie developers and is a much more reasonable price and has pretty much the same type of distruction minus the fractal door stuff but for the price of rainbow six siege you can get about 3 copies for you and your friends.",-1,0
4688730,359560,Shutter,"Read this first before you assume stuff.  Shutter takes place in a seemingly abandoned property, where break inns are very common place.  For this reason the owner of the house has need for the players services, which are remote CCTV's and a little mobile Mars rover.   https://youtu.be/LGgNE-od4JA   The mars rover is the games biggest part and controlling it and it's primary tasks, surveillance and picture taking is mostly okay and fun.  But then the so called horror element shows it's head. The abandoned property is of course haunted by the spirits of the dead and for some reason they decide to try and scare the poor little mars rover. Who of course is made out of circuits and metal.  And that is my biggest gripe with the game. Usually in horror games we control someone or even something that we can relate to and empathize with. A person or an animal even, has the possibility of feeling fear and dread. I myself can't find the emotional connection to the mars rover, that is needed for me to feel the fear it might be experiencing. The player's character isn't in any danger. You just happily control the rover probably a hundred or more miles away from it. If you 'die' its the rover that dies. It's replaceable and so it's possible battery drainage or death hasn't the same impact as a death in other horror games.  I do love the idea though with the camera surveillance and the rover itself but it would have needed some more refinement. I can guess that it draws some inspiration from Fatal frame and Five nights at Freddy's, but in both of those series the player is in some sort of danger.  Now imagine this. You have the opportunity to go to Mars. First person to land there. Amazing right? Or you can send another rover there and take more pictures and soil samples which is important work of course. I don't want to diss the rovers. But I can guess which sounds more appealing to a lot of people.  Its an okay game, but for the horror I can't recommend it. Maybe you'll manage to get a connection to the rover and proof me a heartless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

4688846,359580,Uncanny Valley,"I really want to like this game, as I had been excitedly waiting for its release ever since I played the demo, which I loved, last year, but sadly there still seem to be a lot of bugs to work out and rough edges to polish.  For starters, it would be nice to have the option of multiple save files – the first part of the game is rather slow, and it would be nice not to have to play through it each time you make a run of the game.  I'm also not a huge fan of the sleep mechanic in its present form. While I think having the story paced over multiple days is fine, having to run back and forth between the facility and your apartment gets tedious, fast.  Also, unless I'm completely overlooking something, I think I've already discovered a bug that prevents you from achieving one of the optional objectives. There's a safe you have to open at one point that I'm pretty sure contains a key to a certain area. Based on the clues I've found, I'm 100% certain I know what the combination is *supposed* to be, but nothing happens when I input it. The story eventually still advances even if you're not able to solve this puzzle, but it's frustrating not to be rewarded if you've taken the time and effort to figure it out.  I still want to explore this game in its entirety, and I do like its overall atmosphere and premise, so I hope the developers will work out some of these bugs and rough edges in the coming weeks. Sadly, I can't quite recommend it at this point in time.",-1,0

I can deal with the damage sponge enemies, the almost uncontrollability of the chracther when in drugged mode. It was a challenge.  What I COULDN'T deal with was the cheap battles they throw at you.. the moment the 2nd boss shot me with 2 shots I knew there was an issue. But I presevered through that.. and I didn't feel good about it because that encounter only strengthened my resolve that there were cheap encounters in the game...

The request have been made to the developers and they are aware of it, but six month later nothing changed yet. There is also a painful mouse acceleration which is impossible to disable. Those technical difficulties makes the game unplayable (to me at least). Some computers also have FPS issues which are still waiting to be fixed.  I suggest to avoid until the developers decide to fix those problems. Until then, I don't recommend playing it.",-1,0

4704376,361550,Cradle,"Before you buy this game, please read the reviews thoroughly and know what you are buying. I hoped Cradle would be similar to Sunless Sea, a narrative style game I paid the same amount for, played for 95 hours, and enjoyed thoroughly. It didn't turn out that way. The favorable reviews will tell you what's right with the game, but I had three major problems with it.  First, Cradle had massive lag between control inputs and responses. I had to turn all the quality settings to minimum,  including the resolution , in order to make the game playable. As a result, the graphics were not pretty at all. My computer meets the listed hardware requirements and is capable of better than this.  Second, I see now that none of the reviewers have logged more than seven hours of play time. The game is short, and that's disappointing. Seven hours isn't even enough time for the keyboard controls to feel natural to me, so I never got past that awkwardness to feel immersed in the game.  Third, the cubes. I had read about this controversial minigame, so I lowered my expectations. But I found it jarringly out of place in Cradle and it further broke the game's immersion for me. You can skip the minigame, but only after you've actually failed it. I tried just walking away from the computer for a while during the cubes thing, but that didn't cause me to lose the round - you have to actively play badly in order to lose and get through the section. Worst of all, you have to play the minigame not once but four times. When I learned that, I was actually angry.  The devs have somehow got me to pay good money and spend my precious time playing some kind of Cube Crush Saga game like the ones my mother-in-law is constantly inviting me to play on FB.  As I write this, I'm three quarters of the way through the game and having trouble motivating myself to lose the fourth round of Cubes With Friends so I can, you know, read the ending.

4708251,362090,Siralim," What's good in this game?  Possibility of endless fun for once. It's classic, very deep RPG, with many functions and things to keep track of, great amount of creatures, realms, artifacts, useful items, rituals and so on, and so forth. This game feels very rewarding, it has over 300 achievements but those are designed well, they always reflect your gameplay progress and doesn't demand some ridiculous 'play in this specific, not natural manner' stuff. If I would get this game when I was 10 years old and not during time of 'collecting games' and huge backlogs, I would probably play it for months.   What's bad in this game?  Mainly one thing and I'm really surprise to say it, but... Graphic. I'm usually the person who either enjoy the graphic or simply doesn't care since there are far more important things in games for me. But here graphic really bothered me. It's even more weird since I enjoy simplistic art style and retro games, so I started thinking about it and... Creatures - fighting with them, collecting them, creating your own team - this is the core of this game. And creatures are awfully ugly. And not in: 'I'm a monster so duh I'm ugly' type of way, but: 'I'm badly drawn, so I'm ugly'. And it takes so much fun and pleasure from game that it's almost unbelievable. I can imagine much more people being interested in it, if the creatures was drawn in a better style. And I must admit, I am disappointed to see that the sequel has similar graphic.",1,0

Playing by yourself is also a major flaw as when you play arcade mode or survival mode you can easily get killed immediately and once you respawn.  Arcade mode is often unfair as from what I mentioned earlier also has you fight two of the CPU at once and they can range from really easy or unfair. The bosses are also difficult as most other characters as you will get killed immediately and results you restarting from the beginning  As for character variety you can only get new ones by beating the bosses in arcade mode which are really underpowered compared to fighting them as a boss and the crane game which is pretty annoying to find  Overall dont play this game if you want to have an easy time playing the game,-1,0

4718878,362960,Tyranny,"Great game, lots of people criticize the length, but at the same time I feel like dragging on too long could have hurt this game. (The average playthrough is about 30 hours, if you want to you could extend it to about 50 by doing additional things that I personally found tedious and would just make you beefier than you need to be for the end-game. Maybe if you wanted to set it to path of the damned on trial of iron you'd consider doing them)  The dialogue was great, and the options in dialogue felt like it was the real strength behind the game. So much variety, and an additional system called conquest where you essentially build your own history with 'Kyros'' empire.  However, the action was weak. Boss fights were interesting, (my playthrough had me fighting all of the end-game bosses, but your actions and choices can change that fairly drastically) but unfortunately that's all that really stood out for me. My choices may have led me to having an overabundance of fights, but alas halfway through I was frankly bored with the system, and by the end of it was just letting the game play itself, waiting for the story to come.  I guess the only thing I enjoyed by the end was the options for how you can build your characters and fit them into there own roles, alas they're usually limited to two roles outside of your mc (aka one character starts as what you would assume to be your tank, but options allow you to effectively build him into a dps if you so choose)  There was good voice acting, as well as some mediocre voice acting, and same with the dialogue I found the writing to stand out as very well-done as well.   I found the art to be pretty good, in the environment especially as well as the character design.  TLDR: It feels like a very well-written book where your choices actually matter.

Cons:  - terrible arcade like combat (but slow same time) without any tactical depth (not even comparable to PoE), - the same about character development which more reminds Diablo or crap like Dragon Age: Inquisition than real cRPG, - boring 'classes' - look above, - unintuitive (and much worse than in PoE) interface with sci-fi and mmorpg feel, - no ability to attack whoever you want (it's a must in real cRPG: Fallout 1 &amp; 2, PoE, ToEE), - too few and boring enemies (100:1 for PoE), - 3D models in inventory screen look like manga characters, - there can be only four characters in party same time, - unity engine, - companion AI bugs,  Pros:  - factions, - feel you have influence on World, - story is quite interesting, - ability to do nasty things,  I'm going to finnish Pillars of Eternity in few hours, so I'll probably keep playing Tyranny from time to time.

Even if you don't like this game that much, if you're anything like me, you will still finish it because it is very addictive. It's the same kind of addictive as the best mobile and facebook games are. You can be addicted to stuff that you don't necessarily love, though.",-1,0
4723515,363680,Battlefleet Gothic: Armada,"I've never bothered to write a review for anything before. I liked this game a lot and I believe it deserves more attention...  I held off buying this game at first thinking I was going to wait for a steam sale. Then I watched some gameplay videos on youtube and decided it was worth giving a shot just to be able to play the arcade matches and maybe some multiplayer even at full price. It definitely lived up to my expectations.  What I wasn't expecting was how good the campaign would be. Voice acting is on point and it was a pretty gripping story, however what really suprised me is how they captured the feeling of 'everything going to ♥♥♥♥' rapidly really well. The point where I stopped and thought 'this was really worth the money' was when I found myself with at best 3 planetary systems I could save, the other 5 would have to be ignored and allowed to fall. And it was even worse the next turn and worse the turn after that. It genuinely felt desperite and hopeless, somehow without feeling frustrating.   That moment and when I realised that ramming chaos and eldar ships is a legit tactic. What's that, you have a shiny nemisis battleship you're bringing to battle that's killed millions of people. Wouldn't it be a shame if someone ... I dunno ... rammed into it from 3 different directions... :P  TLDR: If you like warhammer 40K, you will probably like this game. If you're unsure, if it's ever half price or less pick it up.",1,1

4725056,363680,Battlefleet Gothic: Armada,"So far, I'm not entirely impressed. This captures the feel of the WH40k universe perfectly. The charater design, artwork, voice acting, and story is what I'd expect in 40k and it's great. Where this game fails hard for me, is the individual ship AI. I am perfectly fine with micro managing, but my ship captains blatantly drive into each other or stationary objects whilst trying to persue enemy ships with seemingly no sense of self preservation. Being a huge fan of 40k novels, and having read plenty of books that involve imperial navy and the like, I can say for certain that no ship captain is just going to spin his ship brainlessly around and drive into things(unless you actually want to ram the enemy). And so, I find my self CONSTANTLY having to click around furiously to try and get these ridiculous AIs to avoid each other while engaging in a fight. My ability to use any decent strategy is immediately dampened by the fact that I'm more worried about how each ship is about to try and steer it's self towards a target. Second but still pertaining to ship movement, I'm noticing my ships sitting still after finishing an engagement with an enemy. I know I am responsible for my ships here, but there doesn't seem to be any hint of the AI auto engaging after destroying a target. Leaving them so sit still and usually fall out of any advantageous position. I may come back and amend this later- but thus far I'm facing some really frustrating things in this game.  I haven't even tried multiplayer yet, because in the Warhammer universe, I'm generally more concerned about the story/fluff of a campaign.  Pros so far -Nice too look at -It's warhammer 40k -Holy ♥♥♥♥ it's battlefleet gothic -Burn the heretics?  Cons so far -Player ship AI seems lacking (may amend later, maybe I'm just awful but I doubt it given my experience)   ...And that's really it. Do I recommend this game? ...no.

4725101,363680,Battlefleet Gothic: Armada,"Battlefleet Gothic is a game i have been waiting for ever since the release of the tabletop version. All in all this game is fun to play and doesnt look too bad either.   So far my main experience has been with the campaign. Here you are put in command of a small fleet that grows and gathers experience over the course of several battles. The battles themselves are very fast and usually over in 5-10 min. Unforunately several problems dull the experience...  Pro: + Battlefleet Gothic is awesome base material + Graphics aren't too bad + Campaign is fun to play + Cinematics are only slightly animated but still pretty cool + Experience and skill system of the ships  Con: - Stability is pretty bad at the moment. Currently I have crashes around once every 1-2 hours of game time - Fleet size in battles is way too small to convey the epic nature of the battles. I know the fluff material and even there the battles (at least some) are a lot larger. Anyone arguing that this is not the case is requested to look at the cinematics... These in one case show 3 emperer class battleships. So why not allow those during a battle? - Much too small total fleet size: you are given a roster of ships (1 Battleship, 2 Battlecruiser, 3 Cruiser, 4 Light Cruiser, Escorts) that you can fill with the ships of your choice. These slots are not even sufficient to have one of every ship...  - AI in joined battles: In some campaign battles you share your fleet with the AI while the enemy has one large fleet. These are unbalanced as the AI is random in both its choice of ships and in actually fulfilling the mission objective leaving you at a great disadvantage. - general bugs: there are too many to count and a lot of them are glaringly obvious. This should not be the case with a game of such limited scope and with a fairly long postponment and beta time. - skirmish mode: you have the same limitations to fleet size and fleet roster as is present in the campaign. This is both annoying and frustrating. In addition you have to grind your way through several dozen battles to unlock ships. That is simply needless. - multiplayer: lacks several basic functions from team chat to a simple lobby system or even match making. Also you can not play games against a friend. - company communication: as mentioned there are a multitude of bugs and problems. If you check the technical discussion forums you will discover that most of the threads there are not answered by the developers and several topics go completely unanswered.  TLDR: The base material provides a great background and the battles are fun to play and quite pretty. At the same time the limited scope of the game and the large amount of bugs make it completely unworthy of its current price.",-1,0

4744650,364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"I am speaking to you from the Cabinet Room at 10, Downing Street.  This morning the British Ambassador in Berlin Nevile Henderson handed the German Government a final note stating that unless we heard from them by 11 o'clock, that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, that a state of war would exist between us.  I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that consequently this country is at war with Germany.  You can imagine what a bitter blow it is to me that all my long struggle to win peace has failed. Yet I cannot believe that there is anything more or anything different that I could have done and that would have been more successful.  Up to the very last it would have been quite possible to have arranged a peaceful and honourable settlement between Germany and Poland, but Hitler would not have it.  He had evidently made up his mind to attack Poland whatever happened; and although he now says he put forward reasonable proposals which were rejected by the Poles, that is not a true statement.  The proposals were never shown to the Poles nor to us; and though they were announced in a German broadcast on Thursday night, Hitler did not wait to hear comments on them, but ordered his troops to cross the Polish frontier the next morning.  His action shows convincingly that there is no chance of expecting that this man will ever give up his practice of using force to gain his will. He can only be stopped by force.  We and France are today, in fulfilment of our obligations, going to the aid of Poland, who is so bravely resisting this wicked and unprovoked attack upon her people. We have a clear conscience. We have done all that any country could do to establish peace. The situation in which no word given by Germany’s ruler could be trusted and no people or country could feel itself safe has become intolerable.  And now that we have resolved to finish it, I know that you will all play your part with calmness and courage.  At such a moment as this the assurances of support that we have received from the Empire are a source of profound encouragement to us.  When I have finished speaking certain detailed announcements will be made on behalf of the Government. Give these your closest attention.  The Government have made plans under which it will be possible to carry on the work of the nation in the days of stress and strain that may be ahead. But these plans need your help.  You may be taking part in the fighting Services or as a volunteer in one of the branches of civil defence. If so you will report for duty in accordance with the instructions you have received.  You may be engaged in work essential to the prosecution of war for the maintenance of the life of the people – in factories, in transport, in public utility concerns or in the supply of other necessaries of life. If so, it is of vital importance that you should carry on with your jobs.  Now may God bless you all. May He defend the right. It is the evil things that we shall be fighting against – brute force, bad faith, injustice, oppression and persecution – and against them I am certain that the right will prevail.",1,0

Heroes are available of all stripes with extensive experience trees so you can mold them how you wish. All the commanders have their own trees as well, making playing and leveling even minor lords interesting. Every legendary lord has a quest chain as well as they level.

4752682,364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Firstly I don't think that this is necessarily a bad game, however from playing total war games since I can remember i'm a little underwhelmed by this installment.  It seems like Total War games are moving away from empire building into a more combat focused game. There is very little to do other than fight in these games (granted the game is called total war), whereas in the previous games you felt a little more control over your empire.  I think my biggest gripe is still the inability to build more than 6 buildings in the biggest settlements and then only once you have maxed out the town size, in your faction capital would you really only expect to have 6 useful buildings!?  Main Pros / Cons IMO;  + Unit rosters are initially fun to experiement with + Graphics are an improvment on previous game + Maps look more imaginative  + General / Lord tech trees / skills &amp; armor are a welcome addition  - After a few hours rosters become limited - No small settlement battles?! - Very little ability to micromanage your faction, very combat focused - Seem to have missed out plenty of elements that made previous games good (naval battles for a start)  I'd reccomend it to anyone who hasn't played total war before, but will be spending more time on Rome 2 than this in the future.

4752760,364360,Total War: WARHAMMER," Updated on 16/07/16   Update:  NOT EVEN TWO MONTHS AFTER RELEASE AND WE GET A FULLY FLESHED OUT FACTION COSTING £14 WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE MAIN GAME IF IT WAS READY, WHAT THE HELL CA. Chaos V2.0.  Why do you have to pay £62 for a game which isn't even complete yet?  -------------------------------  tl;dr I'd rate it a  5.5/10  4.5/10. This game is NOT worth  £48  £62  Unfortunately CA really half-arsed Total Warhammer. At it's current state I cannot recommend it, at least not while it costs  £40   £46   £48  £62(!!!!!!), simply because while it is fun to play, after several hours the tedium starts to build, and I find it hard to justify the money spent on this (At this early point, I'd like to stress. I'm sure the game will improve vastly, like Rome II and Attila have, but until then this will stay a negative review).   I'll be curious to see what price CA will charge for the Chaos Warriors DLC, because that potentially lifts the game from costing £40, to a grand £45.    Pros:  -  A.I is actually semi-competent for once, which is unusual for a Total War title  Nope, still terrible - Spellcasters get a nice variety of spells - The magic system is very easy to pick up - The agent system is pretty nice, especially how you can deploy them as individual units on the battlefield - The horrendous system of having to balance unrest in Rome II and Attila has been removed - Being able to customise Lords and Heroes is a great addition - Is actually somewhat decently optimised, as I get a solid 30FPS on my potato, which got a nice 10FPS from Rome II at launch - Units have weight, and cavalry once again packs a punch, which allows battle lines to move - Mods have proper support now - Factions have a nice amount of variety between them, although IMO the rosters are still slightly lacking  Cons:  - As far as I've seen, CA have skimped out on the unit animations a fair bit - I'm particularly disappointed with the animations of Crossbowmen, as they are one of several units without reloading animations - Buffing spells have pretty terrible effects - just a fast moving 'airy' aura around them which disappears quickly. Personally I was hoping for something a bit more interesting, especially seeing how much content CA have skimped on - Settlements? Never 'eard of 'em. In my first 6 hours of play, and countless battles ingame, I've literally only seen one settlement, and that's only because whilst I was playing as the Empire some Skaelings besieged Altdorf. If a battle commences over a minor town/city, then the battefield will be a randomly generated map, no different to attacking or defending out in the countryside - Being able to only assault one side of a settlement is disappointing, because it means that your tactics are the same more or less every single time, the only time it changing is when you get a new unit to play with. Unlike all the previous iterations of Total War, I actually HATE siege battles, because it's so clunky and there's so little choice and tactics involved. - The 6-4-4 building system that Rome II brought in which is absolutely infuriating, and should be done away with - Trade is absolutely useless - Diplomacy is absolutely useless, although fair enough it's a Warhammer game, but defensive and military alliances should at least be useful for something other than just raising opinion of you to the point you can confederate with the faction in question - A lot of spells are unbalanced, although this will probably get patched soon - A lot of range units are unbalanced although this will probably get patched soon - CA shouldn't be relying on modders to add in essential parts of the game, like being able to occupy whatever settlement you'd like regardless of the culture (Human, Dwarf, Norsca, Greenskin etc). It's just more that they've not bothered with - NO BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD! (No blood or gore) (Unless you want to pay £2 for even more cut content) - Chaos Warriors is still cut content - Due to the autoresolve being very very generous if you are estimated to win a battle and auto it you take very few losses. Because AI vs AI battles are treated as being autoresolved this means that strong armies will stay strong until you actually physically fight the battle. This also means that filling your army with trash units (In the case of the VCs, Zombies) you can just autoresolve all your battles, taking very few casualties while destroying smaller yet technically better armies than your zombie stack. This is why the VCs will steamroll other factions after about turn 50-60 - they can just spam zombies  A personal note is that I feel that the game feels a lot smaller in scale and depth than what was shown in trailers and videos by CA showing off the game (Which is to be expected I suppose)  I cannot see where CA have put all their resources for this game. I really, really, really hope it's not towards DLC. I miss the glory days of PC gaming, where expansion packs actually added hours and hours to the game, and lots of new content, and in the case of Rome I and Medieval II, adding hundreds of hours of gameplay. Those were the days where you got over a dozen fully fleshed out factions from the very start, instead of 4 + 1 integral faction you have to pay for.  All in all, Total Warhammer is by no means whatsoever a bad game, but it isn't fantastic either.",-1,1

4752898,364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"I have stuff to say about the game but very dissatisfied. I completely stopped playing the game. Waste of money for a full price game. I have been playing TW since Shogun in 2000.  I bought the game a few days after release but it was a bad experience. Game is incomplete and inferior because a month after release, and again a month later, 'new content' came on sale. All that time I spent playing the game, from 1st week of release, was without gore; a watered down PG13 experience apparently. Great way to reward an early adopter.  The game feels kind of ruined now and I don't feel like having to pay again to get the complete experience for a game I paid full price for. Its easy to see why companies get accused of witholding content so they can sell DLC. I like to support companies by buying additional content, I don't like being charged for content which should have been in the full-price game.  I bought the game early because I wanted to support the developers and game. I guess that could be exploited by companies to sell sub-standard products to fans.  The game itself - it was great. The smoothest game experience I've ever played. It feels less like a strategy game with an RTS bolted on, more like the two parts have merged and compliment each other better than ever. The Lore feels great, loads of character and it suits the TW series. The battles are epic, the campaign is epic as are the graphics - unless you are playing a gimped version like I was.

4753318,364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"The Beastmen DLC killed the game for me. Some of the units are fun to use (Minotaurs) but the rest of the roster is pretty bland.  I played through the mini-campaign and thought it was ok, but no where near as much fun as the ones added to Medieval 2 with the Kingdoms expansion. The grand campaign as the Beastmen isn't very fun. By the time you fight your way out of your starting positions the Chaos hoard will be annihilating the rest of the factions. Most of my 'quests' were aborted because Chaos had already killed off my targets. Once I was out of Bretonia there was nothing but wasteland.  I was able to complete the short campagn objectives, but not the long because there just weren't enough settlements left to raze. To beat the Beastmen's long campaign you have to raze 10 more cities then the actual chaos faction. WTF is that all about?  But those are really minor annoyances to me. They're the kind of oversites I've come to expect from game developers. The next is the one that really pisses me off. I bought the game before the Beastmen were introduced and want to be able to continue to play without them in it. Them being there completely changes how some of the other factions play (empire is the one I care about) and I do not find it fun. I don't want to be dealing with chaos curruption and it's ugliness from the first few turns of the game. I want to be fighting in green fields and forests. I also don't particularly find fighting a guerilla war from the very begining of the game (as the Empire) to be very fun. It's not the game I bought.  In my view all content patches should be implemented as mods that people have the option to use, or not.  Think of it this way, you and your friends bought the Warhammer Table Top rule book's 3rd edition and really really enjoy it. Now imagine that when the 4th edition comes out you're forced to play it and only it, wether you enjoy the changes or not. Maybe you like most of the changes but would like to continue to keep a few things from the earlier edition. You are never given that option with this. If you don't update you can't play.   I also don't like the vitriol I see developing around the leader boards. I would like to see that system scraped and replaced with something like the ranking system used in chess, with the option for people to specify rules (usually unit caps) for games they begin. Even chess has many variations that people enjoy playing online.  I don't personally think games like this can be well balanced for both single player and multiplayer. There are just too many unit types and factions to do both well. So let people set their own restrictions for the games they play. Also eliminate the drama surrounding leaderboards by giving players a point score like the ones used to rank chess players.",-1,0

Honestly I have only played one game in this trilogy and that is rome total war which was released on September 22, 2004. Now let us compare the content with these games. First of Diplomacy, there is no diplomacy in this game... Legit you can not create an ally with another faction who is not the same facton, for example a human empire is going to have a insanly hard time creating an alliance with dwarfs. The only diplomatic thing you can do in this game is merge factions who have to be the same species as you such as human faction merging with another human faction. Second of repetitiveness, you are amased at how amazing this game looks in the first few hours and you constantly want to battle to have some amazing views of the enormous fight. But it gets insanly repetitve, the terrain is always the ♥♥♥♥ing same, the sieges are the SAME ♥♥♥♥ING CASTLE WITH DIFFERENT FLAGS!!!! I decided i dont want to spend mroe time on this piece of ♥♥♥♥ good luck wasting money on this game. A $10 game has more ♥♥♥♥ing content then this. Do yourself a favour and buy rome total war.",-1,0

4757877,365020,Gynophobia,"This is a short, unusual game, that has graphics (on its very best setting) comparable to Half-Life 1. There's not much to say about it after you've known the premise about women and spiders, because that's all there is. It will last you an hour or two. There are no jumpscares. Enjoy.",1,0
4758834,365210,Hollywood Visionary,"I'm going to confess straight up that while I'm definitely 'a reader', it's slowly dawning on me that reading is not the main reason that I play video games. This may have something to do with the fact that I'm currently a university student, so I have quite enough reading to do as is, thank ya very much! As it stands, however, I finished this one in just a couple of sittings, thanks to how exceptionally well-written and cleverly designed it was, and it gave me a few solid chuckles along the way as well.     Now, if you're one of those people who finds themselves constantly complaining about the lack of actual CHOICES one gets to make in a lot of so-called 'interactive novels', you're unlikely to complain about THIS one. In the first ten minutes alone you're forced to choose the name and gender of not only your own but other characters, and almost everything that your character does or says from then on in requires a decision, sometimes from a pick of a good five to ten options! You truly choose YOUR OWN adventure in this one. (Just to give an example, by the end of my first scene I had decided that I was a film director named Cliff Flowers - I'm a Killers fan, what can I say - who had just pitched a studio exec a horror-comedy set during the Running of the Bulls in Spain! That's exactly the kind of customisation you can expect if you give this baby a burl.)    Now whether or not the story in question is liable to set your world on fire is a slightly more subjective thing, and obviously all the non-readers out there should just LEAVE THE STORE PAGE NOW and go find themselves a Sam to get Serious with (it's literally JUST WORDS, not even any pictures or music)! Personally, I found it all rather interesting and enjoyable, but then again, I've been an amateur filmmaker myself and have always been fascinated by the dubious ins-and-outs of the movie business, and there's no denying that the McCarthy era makes an especially intriguing backdrop to a game.   I won't lie and say that I've played a whole lot of games in this style, but I'd be pretty darn surprised if this wasn't one of the better ones. Oh, and for those of you concerned with cost, you can stop fretting: The sheer multitude of choices one can make guarantees EXCEPTIONAL replayability. On my first two-hour playthrough, I've only netted 16% of available achievements, and I'm yet to even MEET Alfred Hitchcock, much less make a movie with him. I CAN confidently say, however, that Orson Welles does have one little ♥♥♥♥er of a DOG...   Verdict: 8/10.    (PS You know you've got what it takes to be a real-life film writer/director/producer when you give yourself a CORONARY! Even got the achievement to prove it!!)",1,0

That being said, I will say somethings that I wish the developers would improve on:  1) It isn't clear when you should switch between your terminal and your display. (This is my biggest complaint, because I tried doing most of it in the terminal).  and  2) Some times I would do the mission, and then leave only to realize because I didn't watch the guy's heart rate go down, it didn't count.

Unfortunately, it's not fun for long. Once you complete the main missions, the game gets REALLY boring. The only things to do are the Dark Zone which has hackers and is just basically grinding, and some random other missions that are not worth your time.  Fun for the first 30 hours, boring the rest of the game. I don't recommend paying a full 60$ like I did.",-1,0
4768141,365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,"Tom Clancy's The Divison is incredibly fun and exciting.  However I can not play it anymore as it is THE ONLY GAME EVER to give me eye strain and make me feel dizzy. Even with long breaks and very short play times.   I've tried the recomended settings, FOV and Chromatic Aberration off, played with colorblind settings, turned down the brightness on my monitor and have worn Gunnar glasses when playing. I even upgraded from a 770 to a 970 in hopes that maybe it would help. Doens't work, just buys me a little bit more time to play before I feel the symptoms again.  I will never recomend a game to anyone if it has a chance to hurt someone physically, with possible long term damage.",-1,1
4768167,365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,"I loved the idea of the story, however the way it was carried out was a bit.....ehh. I think that's the only way I can describe it. The city looks amazing but it's a bit unfortunate that you cant access a lot of the buildings or the skyscrapers and their upper floors.  The storyline quests were a bit naff in my opinion. Run and grab this, activate this, shoot some guys while you're at it. It all seemed very repetative.   The Dark Zone seems to be the only place that's kept me playing now and then as it gives that feel of eeriness into the game while looting as you never know what may come round the next corner, but as before, access to buildings are very limited.  I would definetely play this more if there were more areas available rather than the base one and if the level cap got raised by a considerable amount, but right now, in my eyes the game lacks a HELL of a lot of content.",-1,0

I'm not going to post a long winded review, just notice the theme amongst all the negative reviews.  Update1 Game is still complete garbage. It's been months and the added 'content' is laughable. The same glitches are there ( not being able to interact to turn in quests is a big one I've had problems with from day 1). The gameplay is still undewhelming, the city devoid of anything worthwile. They could've made this game mission based with the option to co-op like a resident evil game and it literally wouldn't effect the content at all, that's how lifeless and useless the map is. I'll post again after a few xpacs because I was dumb enough to pay for a season pass before launch. Won't be making that mistake again with Ubi.  Update 2 1.4 patch came out, logged into my game and there's literally no difference. Enemies are a bit easier to kill now and you get items for levelling past 30. Tried matchmaking for a mission and literally waited over 45 minutes for it to find another player. Either overlevel the content or trick your friends into buying this.

4772884,365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,"Currently I am a level 18 in the Division, so i cannot talk much about the endgame. I got this game after a recommendation from a friend and after playing the beta. While it has had it's ups and downs, overall it is quite a solid title. I haven't even begun to explore exterior areas like the dank zone, so I am not the full way through it, but for the parts I have played, I'll give it 8.5/10. Seeing as every big games media wants to compare it to destiny, I will also. As a light 310 in destiny before quitting a little while after the taken king, I had essentially completed the game and there was ♥♥♥♥-all to do, apart from the raid and the nightfall missions, which were high effort, low reward. I think The Division by comparison has it's stuff worked out. They have a far superior looting and rank system to destiny and above all, the game is of a higher quality.   I do have a list of things that Massive, the devs, could work out that would make the game a whole lot better  - Level scaling in missions with higher leveled players is ♥♥♥. I have a lvl 26 mate join me to do some missions and he has to essentially carry me through the process, as I die in one shot  - They need to make the dark zone more accessible to entry level players (1-7), as the first level bracket is 1 - 14, meaning that lvl 5s will get one shotted by lvl 10s.  - Obtaining High end weapons and armour should be more balanced.

4782673,365860,Spaceman Sparkles 2,"First of all, graphics are mostly nice, but there is a lot of questionable decisions, like the fact that a lot of special effects obscures playing field and makes hard to tell things apart. Music is passable, but very repetitive. Second, the controls. In fast-paced games such as racings or shooters they can make or break a game, and this game is broken. Seriously, who made a decision to place skills on numerical keys? Or make a character so slow? Or make game menu in such a way, that you can't just change a single key, you need to map everything from the scratch? Third, levels are empty. I mean, there is nothing at all except occasional lump of pixels denoting an NPC or enemy and maybe a few 'puzzle' elements, and that's it. Plus, what's the point in making a large level, if most of it is lava/water instadeath floor anyway? And finaly, this game, fundamentaly, is not hard. It's just cheap. Making boss arenas such small that boss takes 1/4 of it is cheap. Making teleport the only thing you'll upgrade regurally as rest of skills caps out on the first-second upgrade is cheap. Making grand empty areas just to pad the playing time is cheap. In essence, I'm not recommending this at all. Not even on sale, not even for trading cards, not at all.",-1,0

4783150,365960,rFactor 2,"Some people may talk highly of this simulator but I have a completely different view.  Ever since I had a demo some years ago installed in my computer which came as a bonus with a graphic card that I purchased and after having bought the complete version I never again had this software installed I preferred the NKPro, GTR2, GT Legends and later Race07 which seemed to me better than the rFactor.  For the amount they quote I would prefer to spend twice for Assetto Corsa or get two years in iRacing than a free lifetime (lol) with rFactor2.  The game freezes the graphics are poor the interface looks the same as well the simulation. Even the RaceRoom that I consider better than the rFactor2 has better graphics and realism.  All simulators have their motorsport world stars, all reproduce the tracks and cars in perfection and realism by modern methods but online multiplayer are empty except for a few championships that take place behind closed doors.  If I cant get good graphics I do not need tire deflection if the simulation is perfect.   The rFactor2 was born to make money!! What they did in this new project could have been done in the old rFactor, you can see it in iRacing which is one of the best platforms that go around.

4785276,366320,Seasons after Fall," https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcYkjwExse4   A very simple yet fun intiutive 2D adventure game. The world of seasons after fall is magical and mysterious, the narrator loosely guides you along the story whilst you are confronted with different puzzles and challenges to overcome.  My favorate aspect of this game is by far the intuitivness, you are not directly told what to do nor is your hand held.  The art style is fitting and very unique, couln't imagine anything else.  Other than that the game is very slow paced and does not seem to be very long.  Overall a great game for those of you who like to relax, listen to a great soundtrack and be immersed into a magical world.",1,0
4785290,366320,Seasons after Fall,"This game is stunning, the visuals are the best part, the music is fun and creative. Overall a good game to play just to relax. A big issue for me was the ending. It seemed lackluster and anti-climatic. I'm still confused and not even sure what I'm supposed to take away from the game.   Its a bit frustrating as well as there are no maps, unlike in Ori. It made navigating some parts extremely confusing and often times I went in circles quite a bit before having to painstakingly seek out help from online sources to get past a certain point in the game.   Again the ending seems to have such a large plothole that I see no point in any sort of replay value other than to look at the art style this world is set in. Other than the fact I had issues with where I was supposed to go based off memory alone this game is a good play for 5-6hrs.   Personally for the price I expected more play time and content from this game, or at least some replay value.",-1,0
4785461,366440,Savage Resurrection,"Long review coming with some in-depth analysis, but I am trying to provide as much useful information as possible for people who are considering purchasing the game.  First just so you know who this review is coming from. I put thousands of hours into Savage 1 where I was a top competitive commander in the US scene (lifetime competitive record of 77-1-1). In Savage Resurrection, I may have more time in the game than anyone else. I am ranked #1 in total wins, #1 in total score, and near the top of the leaderboard in most other categories. Now onto the review.  The main reason why I do not recommend SavageRes is due to the poor new player experience. SavageRes is lacking a tutorial for learning game mechanics on both the FPS and RTS parts of the game. I watched much of Warowl's stream (a pro-level FPS player, but new to Savage), and he was confused about many things, so I can't imagine how confused the average new player must be.  Essentially the first thing that happens to a new player is that you get thrown into a live game as an FPS player. Now in most modern games, you would get matched up with other new players. However, SavageRes also has no skill-based matchmaking system, so your game likely has a few pro-level players in it. You will get killed again and again and probably not even have any idea why you are dying. An analogy would be if a brand new player got thrown into a game of CS:GO against GeT_RiGhT or into a game of LoL against Faker. Wouldn’t be very much fun right? I believe the new player experience is why 99.9% of the ~50,000 people who have played SavageRes have quit.  If you are interested in the RTS part of the game, the new commander experience is even worse. The only way to practice being a commander is against the really horrible AI commander where both teams are all bots. In a real game, you will ruin the game for your entire team if you play poorly. Or even if you play just average but are matched against an experienced commander on the other team, you will still ruin the game.  Now if you manage to get past the new player experience and stick around, the game is pretty fun. After all, it is the reason why I have played so much. However, the game still has a laundry list of issues that prevent it from being more than just a “good” game. These issues include:  Some people experience crashes or are not even able to start the game.  Lots of bugs. As an example, a few patches ago, a new bug appeared where enemy units die standing up. I’ve seen people shooting at these standing corpses, not understanding that it is a bug and that the player is actually dead.  Lack of optimization. People with top end gaming computers are still getting frame rate loss even while playing on low graphics settings.  Once people are on a server, players can freely join whatever team they want, and there is no in-game skill balancing. Mid-level players will often just wait until they see what team the “good” players join, and then try to follow them onto the same team. This can lead to massively stacked teams.  The game is not VAC-Secured, and there is a confirmed aimbot/maphack available since the game was released. Nothing has been done to address the cheater issue.  The game is decently balanced as far as human vs beast (despite what others less experienced players might say). However, the big “balance” issue is that it is nearly impossible to win a game by just out killing the other team. So the optimal strategy for winning is usually to avoid enemy players and to go after the other team’s workers and buildings. This fact is a problem because the most “fun” part of the game is the player vs player combat, which you must try to avoid if you want to win and not just play a 60-minute stalemate.  Lack of a dueling server (or more generally a “sandbox” server) where people can practice fighting, test out how different weapons and items work, or just hang out while waiting for more players to come online.  Melee combat seems really “clunky”. I have played this game a ton, and I still can’t quite figure out why, but something just seems “off”. I have times where I can swing right through the other player and not score a hit, but other times when I totally miss my opponent, yet I score a hit anyways.  Only 6 maps and no map editor for the community to generate more.  Very poor voting system. Such as no information given on commander experience when he is requesting to command. It is easy to get stuck with a newbie commander. Then it is nearly impossible to pass an impeach vote once you find out that he is actually a newbie. There is also no vote option for next map, restart, etc.  No support for the competitive (e-sport) scene if one were to ever develop. For example, you can’t even have a password protected server to prevent newbies from joining in on a competitive game.  No difficulty setting adjustment on the in-game bots. Bots can dominate new players, but an experienced player can just kite them around with ranged weapons all day.  General lack of useful information in the HUD as to what is going in relation to the overall strategy aspects of the game. For example, I have had games where the enemy team makes a sublair (spawn point) right outside our base. I immediately recognize the game-ending danger. However, despite my best efforts to communicate with my team, no one comes home to defend, and we quickly lose. After the game, half my team is like 'how did we lose!'  The commander UI is missing some features that have been found in all RTS games for the past 10 years like being able to queue commands. Also a big feature missing is the ability for the commander to draw on the mini-map in order to let his team know what is going on.  In game VOIP is very buggy. People tell me that I am hard to understand or that they can’t hear me at all.  The in game spectate options are very poor. You can’t chose to spectate a specific person without flipping through every player on the server. You can’t see the HUD of the person you are spectating. You can’t lock onto a player to follow them after they respawn. You can’t see the HP of buildings, players, or the amount for stone left in mines. There is no kill feed.  Steam achievements do not work, eliminating the “carrot” that is found in many modern games. Related to the last point, the leaderboard has very few useful stats reported. Plus some of the stats are bugged, such as player score per minute.  Now the last point in the review is about the game developer, S2Games. In my opinion, if S2 improved the new player experience as well as started addressing some of the other issues on my laundry list, this could be an amazing game; like it could be as big as LoL. Unfortunately, during early access, the players brought up the new payer experience issue as well as all of these other issues, but S2 instead continued to focus development on other areas. It quickly became clear to the players that S2 really has no idea what they are doing. The general consensus from the fan base is that S2 released the game when it was still in early access. There is still much work to be done to 'finish' the game.  Unfortunately, it also now seems pretty clear that S2 will not be supporting SavageRes anymore. Other than two minor patches in the last few weeks, there has been no public communication from the developers on the forums in over 1 month. Also, I have the privilege of being part of a private channel with the S2Games developers. But even there, we have not heard anything from the developers in over 2 weeks. So just to warn potential buyers, this recent steam sale seems to be nothing more than one last money grab by S2 for an abandoned game.  I will continue to play this game until it completely dies, because at least for me, the game is still fun. It’s just sad knowing how great this game could be with a proper development team and sufficient resources devoted to it.",-1,1
4785973,366440,Savage Resurrection,"New Review ================  S2Games back to their old ways, stay clear. If the game gets fixed enough you should hear about it enough to buy at that point. Games current state is a clear DO NOT BUY.   Old Review ================  TLDR: it's Savage! If you liked it then buy this now.   Game appears to be a faithful remake. They have taken the exact numbers from the original. Melee feels slightly off but I am sure it will be resolved.  There is no P2W. There is just cosmetic stuff which could be pretty cool, but who cares if the core game is there.  12v12 is an issue, far too small however expect it to increase once possible.  EDIT: now 16v16 for official servers, custom servers can do more. Needs official servers to allow more for the game to live imo.   But the main reason to buy? Remember the first time experiencing the Behemoth in the original? The epicness of that huge thing using a tree as a mother♥♥♥♥ing weapon! Well you get to experience that again because the Behemoth is more epic than ever!  I was super sceptical about this game, more than any other game ever. I kept telling people to stop getting their hopes up because they will mess it up somehow. I have been proven wrong.  EDIT: still hard to say if this game will make it with some weird decisions by S2Games, my skepticism is back.",-1,0

4790763,367500,Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen,"Dragon's Dogma's best features are two parts. First, it's combat, the second, it's pawn system. Both unique to Dragon's Dogma alone.   What drew me into the game was when I first scaled a giant monster and start swinging attacks at it's head while holding for dear life. Though you won't be doing this all the time, it certainly is a combat feature that stands out. When fighting smaller mobs, the combat plays out similar to games like Dark Souls or Monster Hunter. You'll be using the learned combat skills and spells that you've acquired to wreck havoc on enemies that stands in your way. These skills will drain your stamina bar, so managing regular attacks and special attacks will be key to your survival. The combat overall is very player skill based, but has all the pre-planning of equipment and skill management that people have come to love about RPGs.  The ally system, or 'Pawn' system of the game is especially interesting. You create your own Pawn, it's appearance, and class, and you'll be able to level it up while setting up it's skills to compliment your desired party make up. The interesting part of this is, that Pawn you designed will be uploaded into the game's server and exported into other people's games. Other players will then hire it and will bring back treasures given to it back into your game, as well as knowledge of quests completed in other people's games. You of course, will also be able to hire other people's pawns into your game. This passive online feature helps create a connection to the greater world of Dragon's Dogma. It's one of the game's most unique features, and in my opinion, one of it's best.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nYFqwfvi5Y  As far as equipment, exploration and story is concerned it's pretty average to be honest. The stat and equipment is pretty run of the mill RPG, nothing you haven't seen before. The exploration, though vast in scale, is not nearly as interesting as exploring worlds in other games like Skyrim. The story of the game is pretty forgettable, and certainly was not an aspect that kept me playing.  The presentation of the game is acceptable. Keeping in mind, the game was originally released in 2012, the PC port being so late, it definitely shows some age. Compared to more contemporary AAA games, the game's low texture resolution, dated lighting, and lower polygon meshes become very apparent. It's not an ugly game, and still looks great, but it's age definitely shows.  Though there is much to love about the game but it's not perfect. The game suffers from a lot of rinse and repeat gameplay loops. So basically there's a lot of repetition and grinding involved. The traversing in the game seem to be inspired from RPGs of old, before quick travel, as quick traveling is something that is earned, and a valuable commodity, rather than a convenience feature that we've grown accustomed to from other open world RPGs. And as mentioned before, the story is very forgettable. Hell, I stopped paying attention to it altogether.  Overall, Dragon's Dogma is a great ARPG with a very enjoyable combat system, and an unique party system. Though it's other parts are a little mundane, this is a rare case where the sum of it's parts, is greater than it's whole.   Pros: - Excellent combat - Climbing giant mobs is exhilarating - Passive online 'Pawn' system is well conceived - Large overworld map - Addictive gameplay loop  Cons: - Slightly dated graphics - Large world relatively uninteresting to explore in detail - Traversing can be grindy  ► Review Created on Update: 18 January (last update date) ► Hours played: 25 ► Completion Status: Incomplete ► This copy of Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen was purchased on Steam",1,0

4791120,367500,Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen,"Dragon's Dogma : Dark Arisen  You beat Dark Souls 1, 2 and SoTFS. You miss Monster Hunter? Well Dragons Dogma is a nice mix of the two and a damned good game/port besides!  Out of the gate you have access to all the DLC that was released with the game, that means the extra voice packs, hair, armor, weapons, etc. You also have access to Bitter Black Isle which i suggest waiting to visit for anyone new to the series as it is ten fold harder than the base game at a low level.  Pros: (there are a lot here)  The port has been vastly upgraded from its original ps3 debut. It supports 4k upscaling and runs at 60fps or higher if your monitor can do so.  The fighting is smooth and fluid.  Many weapons, classes and enemies to fight. There is even a very dark night cycle that may scare you at first. Especially when you see the glowing eyes of a Chimera off in the distance just staring at you.  There is a lot of customizing for those of you that love making your characters look unique in game and during character creation.  The game itself is solid and while the story is not the best you really play for well the challenge as the game boasts a hard mode plus a new game plus mode that adds a lot of replayability. Not only that but there is a second cylce after you originally beat the story which causes the game to rehase enemies making them new versions of themselves. Much harder and they will chew you up and spit you out.  Cons:  None that i can think of except from a port standpoint which is it doesnt support wide screen monitors or super wide screen so keep that in mind.  also the J-pop song is not the title song as the original game had due to licensing issues but with mods i think that will change soon!  Overall the game itself is great. Im horrible at writing reviews, but i can whole heartedly recommend this to anyone that loves high fantasy and a bit of a challenge. Always carry a lantern and a bit of oil.  TO ALL THE OTHER GAME PUBLISHERS MAKING ♥♥♥♥ PORTS AND KILLING OFF GOOD IPS TAKE A LOOK AT CAPCOM BECAUSE THEY ARE GONNA WALK TO THE BANK WITH THIS PORT!  Thank you Capcom for bringing this game to the PC and if you do decide on another installment of the Dragon's Dogma series, please consider a PC release as well!",1,1
4791213,367500,Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen, After the 2nd playthrough and Bitterblack Isle  Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen is an action-RPG. The game is something between:  Gothic II;   Dragon Age: Inquisition (if you play online with AI companions);   Shadow of the Colossus.     Update.,1,0
4792296,367500,Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen,This game is difficult to review. I really wanted it to be awesome and it had so many great reviews. On one hand it is epically awesome and on the other hand it is dreadfully boring. So I will just jump to the pros and cons. The short version is that I would not recommend this game. The 26hrs I put into it was boring and grinding for without cause.  Pros • The story is pretty fun (when you can find it). What makes it fun is the character you design is exactly who you see in all the cut scenes.  • Awesome creature battles. You get to fight giant creatures that look awesome. During battle you can climb up their bodies and stab them on specific spots. • Vocations. The game allows you to pick different vocations and change how you play. I started as a Stride (Archer with Daggers) then moved into a Mage. Fighting styles very different but both are very fun. • Pawn system is super awesome! You get to create a character (called “Pawns”) who accompanies you on your travel as well as hire two additional pawns (allows a team of 4 including yourself). For my pawn I made sure she had different skills than I did. So she basically was an archers while I was a strider. It helped balance skills. Plus the other two pawns made up the difference on our needs.    Cons • Travelling… by far the worst part of this game. This game doesn’t really have a good fast travel system (2-3 exception if you buy magic stones). Travelling normally isn’t so bad except in this world there is basically only like 2 cities. So each mission adds like +30 minutes for travelling.  • Enemy locations. Enemies spawn in the same exact places every single time. So with travelling being so grinding you fight the same enemies the exact same way in the same spots every time. The only variety in it is if you choose a different vocation. The enemies are so tedious. Snooze-fest • Story. On one hand the story is awesome… but it doesn’t really affect the world that you are in. It is hard to find any connection between the missions. I have like 26hours in and tried streamlining the main campaign…. Besides being bored I couldn’t push the mission. I have the mission completed that I could (minus ones on the boards) and the story isn’t moving forward.  • Glitches that lock up missions. On top of the traveling and boring enemies the missions don’t always progress properly so you end up going back for something stupid that didn’t load the first time. Additionally I had missions I couldn't complete because essential characters didnt load.,-1,0
4792624,367500,Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen,"This title is a masterclass in how to successfully introduce new features, and to integrate existing ones into a new style of game. It's a Japanese title dedicated to Western Fantasy, and it is truly a glorious hybrid. Dragon's Dogma is unfortunately a title which I missed on console, and this PC release has seen a whole new market introduced to this game and this studio, many of whom, I wager, are now lifelong fans.  Pros:   Fluid, efficient combat system. Utilising a vocation system which allows for many playstyles, and the ability to change between them essentially at will, allows for exciting and fast paced action.   Pawn system is the best attempt at a co-op single player experience I've ever had; the pawns contribute to your world, to your quest progress, and pick up items you may have missed. They even learn about various enemies and bosses, actively targetting their weak points, even if they learnt about it when travelling with another player.   The boss system is highly reminiscent of SotC, which is a great thing. The monsters you face all have various points you should target for bonuses, whether that be disabling an attack, paralysing the enemy, or more. The ability to climb onto them, albeit a little clunky, is a great feature.   The day/night system. Whilst at first it may seem superficial, the night quickly becomes something to avoid (or seek out if you want challenge). It gives you reason to use that lantern, and to stick to the road when possible.   The world is a fantastically realised place to explore, even if a little bland at times. Around every conspicuous corner or on top of any suspicious rock will be a chest to reward your efforts. Climbing and jumping on rooftops is a most enjoyable pastime.  Cons:   The stamina drain from sprinting will quickly become a frustration. And you'll need the sprinting, as the trek between locations can be a long one (thank god for the Eternal Ferrystone, eh?) Thankfully, the modding community is already getting a piece of the action, and you can either disable or reduce the stamina drain.   Whilst the world is filled with fun and varied equipment, a standard set route is clearly carved out, with some pieces of equipment offering clear statistical advantages over others in every way. This doesn't encourage people to experiment with clothing.   The questing is a bit muddled, sadly. Whilst some can be amusing, many quests are just escort missions, with painfully squishy NPCs who stand around in the middle of the battle even if they're non combatants, or plain kill missions: 'Kill x number of y'.  Middle-Ground:   The story. I've not gotten far enough into the game yet. Perhaps this could therefore be put down as a con, as there has been relatively little direction or focus. No reason for seeking out the Dragon has yet been given. Hopefully will pick up soon.  Basically, a really fun game, that's well worth the time and money. I'll be playing this for a long time to come yet, so check back for more updates.  ",1,0
4793362,367500,Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen,"I like Dragons dogma it handles well on my PC and I can use a controller. If starting out with a new character a majority of side quests are hard to complete because the monsters are so strong. I am a bit sad to constantly kill lizard people only because I dont know why they are attacking me. I dont mind killing the bats or snakes or the rats they cause illnesses if they attack me or my pawn. Dont particularly like calling my virtual comrade a pawn but okay. The visuals are good, 360 degrees of view and no glitching. Also like the customizing feature of my character and my pawn as well as hiring other pawns from other players. And the only con I can think of is clothing options I know more clothes exist apparently those clothes arent open for me just yet to get. The Black Cat offers some nice clothes but super high prices and the armor and clothing is lower in defense than say found clothing in chests. So far I love the game.

4795475,367500,Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen,"A wonderfully unique take on ARPGs that even with all of it's faults IMO deserve more requnition for it's achievments.  Pros: 1.The first and most innovative mechanic, namely the Pawn system might by itself be enough to sell it for many searching for new mechanics in this genre. The ability to completely creat and personalize a primary NPC companion that then gets hired by other players is something that from my knowledge has not been done before or not this way at least. 2.As the store page would indicate the big boss/monster battles are it's other most well known mechanic. Dragon's Dogma manages to make the mechanics of the game feel like you are actually fighting something that could theoretically exist. As in they feel, move, act and react surprisingly natural. Fighting a griffon that won't sit on the ground, no problem just set it's wings on fire and it's grounded. A Cyclops not feeling your blows, if arrow at the ready aim for the eye. Chimera overwhelming you with it's diverse range of attacks, just start going for the one body part that is giving you the most trouble. 3.A slightly different take on the usual fantasy story, with a believable enough world and a very interesting lore-mythos for that world.  Cons: 1.Even though I like the story it's takes quite a while before you start understanding what exactly you are and are meant to do in the overall scheme of things. 2.Few characters feel like they actually are important or are interesting enough to remember. Even the ones that do have personality are in end not that relevant in the story. 3.This one might not be 100% true but from what I saw and read on forums talking about this game, a lot of content was cut. And I mean a lot ( if those rumors are true). What that means is that while what we have is IMO really good and satisfying, as you play the you start feeling like it's not really as big as impressions first gave. And the number of monsters and bosses start feeling repetitive sooner than many would hope.",1,0

4799766,368230,Kingdom: Classic,"Since hearing about the game on IGN and watching a few Twitch streamers play it, it looked like a very relaxing and charming game, so I was really hyped to get it when it released today. I love the minimalistic pixelated feel to the game. The game is strangely addictive and has an air of mystery to it. So far, I've made it up to day XVI and the game is already starting to lose some of it's excitement.   Now, don't get me wrong, I can definitely see this game growing into something much bigger with additional content down the road and community feedback. But as it stands, there's really not much to it. I get the whole 'figure it out on your own' kinda thing, which I love, along with the mild rogue-like elements (randomization and starting fresh). But there's only so long and so many times you can navigate either to the left or right side of the village and do the same thing, over and over again, before it starts feeling mundane and a chore (isn't this the bare definition of insanity?). One simple misadventure while exploring can cause you to die, which always involves getting run down by enemies randomly rushing at you from off-screen...there's no other way to die that I've found. Dying thus causes you to restart the game with a new (random) character from the beginning...only to do everything over again that you have already done multiple times in the past. To add, I've only seen one enemy type, thus far...variated by different masks and such.  So, as it stands, do I regret buying the game? No. Will I still play it? Yes...from time to time (moreso when updates arrive). I'm all about supporting Indie developers. But I really feel that the game in it's current form isn't worth $9.99. $4.99, definitely. Because of this, I can't make a solid purchase recommendation, which is the only reason I gave it a thumbs down. Very bare-bones in content - but give it time, the potential is there, for sure!  Some suggestions:  Tower archers...shoot the frickin' rabbits! Don't just stand up there twiddling your thumbs when you're bored. Builders...could you walk any faster to that next tree? I'm turning into a skeleton here... More enemy variety would be nice. Also add more things to do when waiting for gold to pop up. Add some some sort of collection/stacking element in between games to reward continued play Give more actions and choices available to your King/Queen character (such as killing wild rabbits/deer) Add the option to fast-forward day/night cycles...there are times when gold is sparse and I just want to speed up to the next day.",-1,1
4800242,368230,Kingdom: Classic,"To start off with I will say that this is one of the prettiest games I have seen.  The gameplay doesn't take much to learn. I have played through three runs, losing the first two. It is easy to learn and not too difficult to pick up on how to min-max things. As it stands now I wouldn't recommend this game. There seems to be a set path of improvements, and as a rouge-like that doesn’t bode well. The game doesn’t have much choice other than which side to expand first. The only thing that changes is the placement of resources along the map, but seems to have a set number of them.   The game is lacking a tutorial, not that it is needed, but would be good for those wwho wish to know the exact details. More choices in upgrades and villager development would make this game more intriguing. I look forward to the further development of this game. ",-1,0

4807133,368500,Assassin's Creed Syndicate,"This game is embarrassing to show people. There are so many flaws, technical, narrative, and otherwise. It's a good thing Ubisoft is taking some time off to figure out what to do with this series, because this is the first main AC game I will have not finished, and would have divorced me from the franchise. Unity was a technical mess, but I still managed to finish that.   This is a bad game with a terrible identity crisis; it is so obvious that it was touched by many teams comprising hundreds of people mostly strange to each other because there just isn't any polish to be found. It's a plethora of systems and activites all competing to give the player something to do, in an open world context that is of such modern cliche that I can point singly to this title as the one that convinced me the concept is stale yet garish in its desperation to entertain you.   The controls have always been iffy in these games, but layers upon layers of iterations on contextual inputs and finicky movement culminates into such a frustrating mess for Syndicate. They've solved the problem with the unpredictable parkour by just largely deprecating it with the grappling hook; the streets are so wide, and buildings so far apart, to accommodate the terrible horse &amp; buggy 'driving' system, that the grappling hook is necessary to gain any ground if you want to move or explore above street level.  This entry epitomises the series' fast and loose cash-in development cycles by being a buggy, discordant mess. Frequent crashes, bugs, absurd AI behavior, disjointed narrative -- how they expect the player to invest in the activities being asked of them when it can barely bother to set precedence to do so is just incomprehensible. I thought about just main-lining the story as I have in the past, but it is so heavily discouraged by flashing the proverbial 'advertisement' for a new task / activity / chore every 10 feet you move, that trying to even make sense of -what- or -where- the next story mission is can be its own mini-game; especially given that, for example, you may have 3 different 'Sequence 5' main story quests available at once. Which to pick? It's like they purposely tried to disrupt cohesion around their narrative just out of fear that the player could possibly feel aimless at any given moment. Instead of guiding the player, they dissuade progress.  I also love how, instead of teaching me its systems, it would just inform in a tooltip that I have '51 new tutorial entries' to look at in the menu. Cool. I feel like I could go on, but I've given up on this game, and prattling on and on about a year+ old game's flaws at this point is just an excercise in self-flagulation.",-1,0

For keyboard and mouse, make sure you pick keys you're comfortable with and also happen to work for everything. Playing the game itself isn't a big issue but navigating the main menu and hub menu was a pain to deal with. If you try to use your mouse or specific keys you can't upgrade or progress to the next levels let alone the fact that there are even more dangerous keys to pick from that won't even let you start up the level. Once you get to the core of the game it's fine but having to go through trial and error just to get it to work is something that should have been fixed by now especially for a game that has been up this long.

4820246,369200,,"Despite some good features of the game, it becomes very boring, very fast. Here's why:  Nice: very nice graphics, no hiccups or lag (for me anyway), RPG style to unlock better weapons, Ghost in the Shell theme (really cool for fans), easy to learn and play.  So-so: weapon selection is poor and the unlockable weapons are even more limited. Most of the weapons can only be purchased (in-game, tiny bit by bit, currency) and don't have any XP requirement. Shotguns that kill at 50 meters away, sniper rifles that shoot as fast as machinegun, and machineguns with full auto fire accuracy close to the sniper rifles on almost the same distance. So, pick whatever you like. If spit led, you don't even have to aim much.  Bad: Can't see or select matches, so every time is a lottery and most of the time, you are throwed on the same match that you left. The game only unlock for free 2 characters (the other you need to buy with in-game currency), but the problem is that the game don't tell you that when you begin.  Worse: It seems that the community is dying. Most of the matches are with the same old players that you are already familiar with. Matches with a bunch of players (what i enjoy) appears to becoming rare and rare.  Even worse: In the end, except by the abylities of the characters, it's just another run-and-spray-bullets-everywhere game, much like to Counter-Strike (wich in my opinion, it's a huge draw back for any recent game). Closed maps, with only 2 or 3 routes to anywhere, only 3 types of maps (bomb something, capture points, and deathmatch). After playing a few matches, even doing fine, you'll get bored.  ",-1,0
4820432,369370,Crossfire: Dungeons,"This is one of the worst strategy games I've ever played.  This game has the idea that turn-based strategy is blind shots into a fog of war, with narrow similar style maps, and a lack of any rng statisitcs or stat boosting options. The people who made this game have no idea what they are doing. The gameplay ends up being pretty underwhelming and really ugly, with a lot of basic options and settings missing.  This game can't go into fullscreen, only window mode with letterbox options. You can not adjust resolution settings and there are no seperate audio settings other than on/off with esc. You can't even quit the game from the title screen, you need to x away the window or alt-f4.  I can't get the game to 'auto save' as the developer claims it does while playing Dungeon Mode, so my progress to the second level always dissappears when I turn off the game. I tried several times, but the game failed to care I beat stage 1.  This is a large list of negatives, and I ended up getting a refund within 1 hour.  It's pathetic to see a company try to sell a game that lacks such basic options and operations or a fun factor.  I'm hoping a patch will be released to address these issues, especially the lack of saving progress. If someone can explain the solution to that here, I would appreciate it, but this should not even BE an issue!  Skip this title, there are many better turn-based strategy games on Steam.

4835463,371570,Tap Heroes,"Picture this, the weekend spent in your parents basement, donning a cape made out of old teeshirts, wearing a hat made of tinfoil, and holding in your hand a 8 inch stick you found in the back yard.. huddled around a table with 5 of your closest friends. Teenage angst in your eyes as you reach forward to grab a set of dice and hope that you roll high enough to stop the least liked kid in your group... Jimbo.. dressed up in his high priced ogre costume. You let the dice fly and.... ahh fiddle sticks.. he got the best of you this time..   I can still remember my days playing Dungeons and Dragons, my many days picking up rpg's of days gone past, the Final Fantasies, the Breath of Fires... Dragon Warriors.. well this game is nothing like them, in fact the only thing it has in common with those games or a fun game are the main characters.. Warrior, mage and Thief..   What can be said about Tap Heroes... well the first thing that comes to mind is this game can be found elsewhere for free. The idea behind the game has been done to death lately, the only difference between this game and those games are.. this game will cost you 3 dollars, while the other games like Clickr Heroes are absolutely free to play.  So surely for paying money you get a more well thought out and polished game? To answer that question is NO! Tap Heroes manages to offer less content than you'd get in one for the F2P idling games on steam. While the other game gives numerous heroes or characters to buy, this game offers you a very generic three characters.. The Warrior, The Mage and the Thief, sure they are the cornerstone of any RPG, this game isn't an RPG it's an Idle game.  Everything about this game seems to pale in comparison to the free alternates out there... This game in a nutshell is this... buy upgrades, click on enemies for the first 10 levels, then never click again as your weak clicks don't even make the enemies break a sweat and the warrior is already doing 10 times your click damage by level 5. This game lacks any bells and whistles, no skills for your characters.. you get 6 major spells which you the player can cast,, they are your run of the mill fair, more clicks per second, more gold, wash away an enemy, etc etc etc... nothing special..  So with all this negative surely a game you pay for has some positives to it? Well yes, Tap Heroes is set up like an old fashion puppet show you'd put on by cutting out some paper characters, pasting them to a Popsicle stick and set inside a cardboard box. That alone is pretty unique, also the enemies aren't really as repetitive as the other clicker/idle games, I was surprised to see how many unique enemies the game actually had.. Last but certainly not least is the inclusion of trading cards.. All of which are unlocked for the low price of 3 dollars, unlike the 10 or more you'd need to spend on those other clicker/idle games for cards.  Is this game worth the money.. the honest answer is no, other free games do what this game does... only better.. The only way and I do mean only way I'd recommend this game is if you could get it for under .50 cent, this way you can sell the cards and the game will be free, like it should have been in the first place..",-1,1

Cons..1.mammoth mission sucks controls are awful.  2.dips below 60 fps with 980 ti   3.melee is a one way hit don't expect special moves or finishing.  4.

4837535,371660,Far Cry Primal,"Pros: - The idea is really good. I was looking forward for it. - The graphics are ok for me; probally they should have made the possibility for higher graphic settings. - Also the fire is cool. Unfortunately you can't really burn down the enemy villages; you can put them on fire but this doesn't change a lot. Even in missions where you need to burn down things these things will respawn. - Stroy has good basic approaches, but there could have been done much more. - Language is interesting. But again, there would have been MUCH more potential. - enviroment looks nice and interesting  Cons:  The game is much too easy: The beast taming is incredible easy, you can get a cave lion in the first few hours of the game, even on hardest difficulty. And if you have one you will have no trouble at all anymore, because then you have in short time ALL beasts. You can run through the country with your cat following you scaring and killing everyone you meet while collecting everything you see on the minimap, so that your village is fully upgraded after 10 hours of game play.  It has nothing to do with survival: - no starvation etc - healing too easy; beast revival too (even if the beast is killed in battle you can run to it, give it 3 meat and it will have full health again) - your population can only grow (even if you see your people dying by a enemy attack. Population is only reduced by teamkills) - too much population on close room (bascially every 10m a enemy patrol etc) - beast taming is a joke: throw a few flesh infront of an cave bear who attacked you 2 seconds ago and be best friends with the cave bear 4 seconds later. You can even kill your animals or put them on fire; they won't hurt you at all if you tamed them once. - you can use a owl to scout but its the only owl in the whole world - combat is awful (melee is nothing more than a click orgy; archery is ok though). Beasts will kill everything. You kill a wolf with 1 strike? The enemy warriors of a naturally stronger tribe are murdered 3vs1 by a normal wolf. And I don't even need to say what happens if you have a saberthoot cat... - Poisonous snakes are a joke. You got bitten by such snake? Eat 3 meats and feel fresh like bevor. Or better: You can find the snake with your x-ray before and give it a headshot with your bow).  - No weather (no storm, winter etc) which makes the life in stone age hard   I played Witcher 3 on god mode and even with invulnerability it was more difficult than Far Cry Primal. If you want nothing deep and just rush through a game with stone age setting and repeating missions it's perfect for you.  If you expected to travel through a beatiful world without being attacked every 10m by 2-3 enemy warriors (even if you have a saberthoot cat) and hope that this game is more survival and immersive than Far Cry 4 you might be dissappointed.",-1,0

4839470,372000,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),"This game has been released for a couple of weeks, during which time it's gone from bad to worse.   It started off with a massive amount of bots. They devised a system of reporting, which reduced the number of bots to maybe... half? But half of a lot is still a lot.  Then the software glitches started happening. People simply could not play the game anymore. Multiple rounds of downtime to fix it, and it hasn't been resolved for a significant number of players.  Adding to the mismanagement in general was the lag that came about from allowing server transfers. More people transferred to specific servers than could be safely managed and now we've all got insane amounts of lag. Dungeons take an hour to pop, if you're lucky, despite the fact that you're matched with a party and good to go within a minute of queuing. The queue just... resets itself and you're just left waiting when you could be doing much better things with your limited time in-game.  It has been an absolutely attrocious experience. I'm an avid gamer for over 20 years running and this is easily the most horribly, poorly thought out release I've ever had the misfortune of participating in. People are saying that we should give this game time, but considering how much money has poured in from DLCs, they should have adequate support to sort out basic problems like JUST PLAYING THE GAME as was promised.   People are spamming the forums multiple times daily screaming at the GMs what the most fundamental problems are, and for the most part they've gone ignored.",-1,0

4841344,372000,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),"Bad points:  1. I think there's something wrong with the game font size. I can barely read my inventory or the quest instructions. It's not just tiny but also blurry. I'd rather have it plain and big. They don't have a resolution for 800 x 600. That might also attribute to why the font is impossible to read. They didn't proportion certain things correctly. I squint 1 inch away from my monitor to check how much money I have. It's annoying.  2. Customizing the controls are not so good. I can't use keyboard and mouse at the same time. I think it's only available for certain classes. Why would they restrict it like that? I don't think any other MMORPG does it that way. It's like saying 'barbarians use keyboard only. Healers and Magicians may use keyboard and mouse'. Let me know if I'm mistaken.  3. Loot sharing system is bad. When you're in a party, the person dealing the most damage gets all the loot. Big flaw that they need to fix.  4. Sometimes the scenery will block the path that you need to see/walk through. Like a huge vine covering the road and you might miss the path.  Good points:  1. Music is quite good. Each area has 3-4 of its own tracks. You never get bored listening. A+  2. The color schemes are okay. Your character stands out enough although I think it can be bolder. The maps and layouts look good. Not much repetition.  3. The action is good. Minor collision issues. Attacks are okay. Movement is okay. Consistent framerate, not choppy but not super smooth like Diablo 3.",-1,0

They had a good art style to them. -The setting was eerie, but it was very glitchy, more on that later. -At first the moster attacks are unexpected and makes you be on edge.  Bad: - The monster's model was modeled poorly, but it could've had a lot of potential and made the game alot more enjoyable. - The monster pops up WAY to much which makes him very predicatable. - The AI for the was horrendous, you could have mexicans stand off's with it and it wouldn't flinch. -Tree branches are way to low for not being clipable. -Texture detail for the most part was lazy and it looked like they didn't even bother to give the doll a texture. -The map function was clunky at best; opening when you didn't want it while the monster was attacking you. -Needs more story. -The narrarator was laughable, we found ourself laughing more at his montone speech then listening to the storyline. -WAY to short.  This game is however playable and if you want to have one or two scares without having to spend money or bother learning complex mechanics (which involves reading a map) or storylines then try this game out, it's extremely short, finishing everything in around half an hour later or less.

I didn't even have to play that long until i knew this game was BADWhen i first looked at the screen shots, i thought my heart was going to be pounding every move i made in-game and out. But what i got was a game with an interesting concept, but BARE-BONES game-play and derpy looking enemies chasing me around all the time. Seriously, this game was free, and i see why now. All is Dust didn't scare me at all other than when i first started to play after that random cutscene where i crash into God knows what in the middle of the road. This game has 4 LEVELS, i can count the number of levels on one ♥♥♥♥ing hand. Not to mention that each level is pretty much the same, something is broken and you need that something to get a certain item, to fix said something, you need to find a missing part, put it on the something, use it, and you move on to the next level. THAT'S IT. There's literally NOTHING else i could find. I rate this game a 2/10 i'm being generous with the rating because of how HILARIOUSLY bad this game was.

4857479,374320,DARK SOULS™ III,"I made a single playthrough because I've been playing the Souls games since the original Demon Souls. I love this series. Dark Souls 3 could be the very best yet, but it isn't. Due to a single, but overwhelmingly obvious oversight, this game is not currently worth the time it takes to play. I praised the previous games in the series for giving the player the choice on how to play, how to build their soul slaying hero.  Dark Souls 3 forces the player into specializing their offensive capabilites but gives them no choice on defense. Blocking, and wearing heavy armor, no longer serve a purpose. The only viable options for defense are to roll out of the way or parry.   Some people will read this rant and say 'git gud' but believe me... I am good. I'm pretty awesome at this game, but I felt like my choices were stripped from me as I was forced to adapt to the Iframes given during rolls and the activation frames of various parrys. In previous games you could choose to simply invest in equipment load and build yourself a heavy armored tank, this is no longer an option as the weakest enemies in the game will stagger you in 1 shot, and a dagger wielding invader can stunlock you to death.  Poise Poise is what is missing in Dark Souls 3 Poise is a vital part of the series to date. Poise is the only reason I am not recommending this game. If Poise isn't important to you or if you were planning on making a light armor, ninja esque styled character or a mage in robes then you probably won't notice or care. But, for those who want a bad A$$ in Havels armor strutting around, brushing off attacks without a care in the world... go play dark souls 1 or 2, they're great games still, and they have poise.

To make matters worse, the game won't allow you to play in online mode with a low framerate. Your game session also terminates if your framerate falls too far. The entire UI is obviously designed for console users, and there isn't even a quit to desktop function. You have to exit from the main menu.  Other than that, the game is itself is pretty fun.

Giant enemies who are faster than 120 pound Ninja's with Katanas are ridiculous. The game punishes people who try to take their time with enemies and wait for openings to attack. That elegant dance when fighting mobs in DS1 is gone.  Instead, grab a fast weapon and R1 spam everything to death.  Otherwise, enemies follow up powerful charge attacks with instant recovery and direction changes. 180 degree rotation/shield bashes are the norm here. Dark Wraith flat sword with fire works well here, just R1 spam until they are dead. Easy.  The game is pretty gorgeous and runs well. Lots of rewarding exploring. Lots of shortcuts back to other areas, if not as much as in DS1.  I really hope From patches some of these enemies to give them more realistic abilities.

There are changes I doesn't like comparing to the previous one, but i still a great improvement. However the technical issues are so big that I can't recommend buy it to anyone. Even if you'll be able to fix that crashes near bonfires by lowering light or wearing heavy armor, the connection is still so bad. It's not that bad as in the first game's port on the PC. But still there are tons of lags, glitches with animation, and if you plan to play with friends, just forget it. Now it can take like 15 mins to connect to each other, and that's not a limit at all. Comparing to this, DS 2 was nearly perfect in terms of connection and Internet play. That's why I recommend you to wait for a while, maybe there will be patches. But seeing how From Software ignored problems with PC ports of DS1 and DS2, I'm a bit pessimistic about that. ---------------------------------------------- Updated.

The only problem I have, is that I still can't join any other game as Blue sentinel myself, but I can live with that. That's bringing the question.

4864586,374320,DARK SOULS™ III,"Long story short: issues with cheaters online can get you banned even if you're not doing anything wrong, autosummon covenants don't work for a lot of people, game crashes on 700-series nvidia video cards, and game fails to address problems that have been plaguing the series since Demon's Souls. If you want Dark Souls 1 but better, you probably won't care about the issues, but you've also most likely purchased this game already.   I really enjoyed this game. However, the always-online experience has been sullied by some fools using cheat engine to get -other people- banned from online and bad networking for auto-summon covenants. The steam reviews here are not lacking in detail for either of these issues, so I'll focus on something else that disappointed me as a fan of Dark Souls for a bit.  DS3 does what the series is good at: providing richly designed levels with an interesting setting, a unique multiplayer experience, and a fairly competent combat system. In fact, I'd say that DS3 is the peak of those elements. My issue comes from a multitude of small problems with the game that culminate into this gross lack of care for addressing the worst aspects of the series. Let's list them out!  -The camera is somehow worse than the previous games and will get stuck in the worst possible places all the time. It is appalling how much you have to babysit the right stick. Fighting a giant boss? The camera goes up your ♥♥♥ trying to point up toward them. Trying to fight a normal enemy? Locking on means the camera rises up and points to the floor, obscuring your vision of whatever is around you. This is perhaps the worst camera I've ever seen since the dual joystick era of video games.  -On that note, the lock-on is rotten as well. You will lose locks for seemingly no reason, causing you to do the wrong thing at a pivotal moment, and the lock-on range is incredibly short for magic users.  -Weapon variety is the worst of the series. The weapons you find within the first ten minutes (straight swords/thrusting swords) are the best ones in the game, and there are several weapon categories that are damn near completely ineffectual. Like, sure, you -can- use whips/spears/fists/etc and probably finish the game with them if you wanted, but they're like handicaps vs. any halfway decent weapon. This blows 'cause the fun thing about DS2 and having six weapon slots was the incredible amount of variety you could put into your loadout.  -Poise doesn't really exist in a meaningful fashion, which makes heavy weapons a lot less viable.   -NPC questlines are built to break unless you have a wiki tab open exhaustively detailing you how to finish out their 'story.'  -A lot of enemies have 4-12 hit combos, which is a little ridiculous to deal with unless you have a fast weapon and a good shield. In DS2, you could go through basically the whole game without a shield and be no worse for wear, but the way poise works and the amount of reach enemies get on their long attack strings makes rolling a poor, unsatisfying option.  -Magic blows. You don't get any meaningful faith spells until halfway through the game, sorcery is too slow, too costly, and too samey (though a recent patch has made the FP costa little easier to swallow), and pyromancy is pretty okay but you spend most of the game just using Chaos Fireball and Carthus Flame Arc. Magic-focused builds aren't very fun to play.  -Bugs! DS3 is the most bug-ridden game in the series, hands down. I've seen enemy players skate around in T-poses, monsters with no AI, entire environments that fail to load in, CTDs from having a 700-series card, NPC quests that broke despite working as intended on other playthroughs, getting stuck on the wrong side of a fog wall during invasions, boss fogs I couldn't pass when summoned as a helper, physics that didn't load in properly (like trying to walk onto an elevator and falling right through it 'cause the game forgot to load in collision)  -Online PVP is a damn mess. It's a culmination of the weapon inbalance, the speed at which one can drink estus and draw out fights, bad networking, bugs, cheaters, covenant design, gimmick meta, lag, and more things that I'm probably forgetting. I had fun with it for the first few weeks, but I'm one of those lucky people that can use autosummon covenants and have not run into any cheaters that would cause me to get banned. I've turned off online play since then.  -I'm probably the only fan in this series that feels this way, but DS3 spends way too much time fanservicing DS1. The last quarter of the game is basically 'Remember Dark Souls? That was a cool game, huh?' Some ways they integrate the old stuff is interesting, but they really tread the same ground in a way that left me with a weird taste in my mouth.    In essence, DS3 is a great game with flaws that only stand out all the more as the series has progressed. It's really frustrating and disappointing to have some truly great and unique experiences mixed in with utter, complete trash and edges that should have been smoothed over two games ago. As far as first playthroughs go, DS3 is easily my favorite of From's games, but I have very little desire to go through on multiple builds and spend hundreds of hours like the previous titles.",-1,0

4866639,374320,DARK SOULS™ III,"Love the challenging gameplay! Combat is mostly awesome and the environments of this game are stunning.  Unfortunately, the game will randomly freeze for about 1-3 seconds, often during combat, and I have a GTX 1080 video card + i7-6700k proccesor so it's not a problem on my end. I've researched and tried all the common fixes (disabaling steam overlay, playing in windowed mode, rolling back drivers etc..,) but none of them worked.  This is a good game, especially for fans looking to be challenged, but if you have the option, get it for console, cause even though the freezing I've experienced dosen't seem to be an issue affecting everyone on PC, it's not worth the risk cause it essentially makes the game unplayable.

4868000,374320,DARK SOULS™ III,"Although I gave this game a positive marking, I still have issues with it (mostly graphical, but thats really it)  This game is very well-designed, and executes gameplay mechanics far better than Dark Souls II.  The only issue I have been running into is frame drops at random, but that is very seemless, so its not too big of an issue.  HOWEVER, the flickering display/white screen bug stopped me from enjoying this game INITIALLY. I found a solution to this, and used it (That is, to search the config file online, and download it if you do not have it, and set FULLSCREEN to WINDOW)  I went further to download a windowed-borderless gaming software that makes it so any chosen/saved window is automatically resized to a specific res, and eliminates borders.  Other than those two issues, I have ben loving Dark Souls III JUST as much, if not much more than Dark Souls II. I have yet to beat either (obviously for III), and intend to spend the Holidays grinding my ♥♥♥ off and enjoying some Dark Souls II &amp; III.  now to wait for the DLC Season Pass to go on sale! :D  I highly recommend this to those who want more of a challenge, but more balance (compared to Dark Souls II).  8/8 wood b8 lost souls into great arrows again! :D    EDIT: I have completed the game.....I'm not waiting for season pass to go on sale, and neither should you...25 bucks is a damn good price for a complete set of DLC.

4869249,374320,DARK SOULS™ III,"There's some pretty terrible crashing start up bugs at the time of this review.  However in terms of the game itself Dark Souls 3 plays kind of like a best of compilation of Dark Souls 1 and 2.  They fixed the really weird scaling system in Dark Souls 2 (scaling magic weapons) and balances to be more in line with Dark Souls 1. They also took a note from Blood Borne and everything feels a little bit faster and more dodging oriented.  Enemies are much more monsterous and less 'dudes in armor', which also means that predicting attack patterns is much more difficult as well.   In my books these are all good changes and a return to style.  With the increased AI you might find that a lot of the older techniques that worked in Dark Souls such as circling, forward dodge backstab, and relying on one pattern doesn't work anymore. It's almost as if the developers knew what Dark Souls players were doing and have done everything in their power to create counters to it.  The PvP is still as Dark Souls as ever with Embers replacing Humanity. The convenants are a little bit screwy this time around with the introduction of Mad purple phantoms and the ability to invade as an evil sunbro among other things. It will take some time to see if these changes work or not. Luckily Jolly Cooperation is still an active part of the online experience with password guarding as a way to play with you friends.  Most importantly is that they sacked Dark Souls 2's stupid Soul Memory system and it's back to Dark Souls 1's character level being the deciding factor.   In terms of the game's extensive plot lore, this is a much more direct sequel to Dark Souls 1 than Dark Souls 2's kind of disconnected (might be the same place might not be) approach. Now Dark Souls 2 items sort of become the easter eggs in Dark Souls 3 that Dark Souls 1 items were in Dark Souls 2. I like it since it gives us that 'best of' feel to it.  Perhaps the only real mark against Dark Souls 3 is that it's not as impactful as Dark Souls 1 was at the time of its release, nor is it as brave as BloodBorne in changing up the formula. Honestly though after Dark Souls 2 I don't think it needed to be brave and instead it gives us a refined Dark Souls 1 experience which was exactly what I wanted after Dark Souls 2.  If Dark Souls 1 is the Original Star Wars Trilogy and Dark Souls 2 was the prequel Trilogy Then Dark Souls 3 is The Force Awakens.   A return to form even if it seems maybe a bit too familiar for its own good.  I for one though am glad to be Praising the Sun once again for one last time!

4875833,375230,"Warhammer 40,000: Eternal Crusade","BUYER BEWARE :  At the time of writing this review the store page states this game is an MMO, this is a blatant lie the current state of the game has it being a arena based shooter like battlefield. Now I don't know anything about this founders shouting and screaming, not gonna pretend I do I wasn't there but from what I hear they ripped people off. If anything this game is another prime example of : 'Should drag them to court for it.' But that won't happen (if it does I am gonna laugh) Anyway onto the actual game review :  The game holds 4 factions with your run of the mil classes (assaults, heavy weapons flyboys etc.). The factions are : Spacemarines, orks, eldar and ofcourse the glory's of chaos (totaly not a chaos fan totaly) Next to that there are microtransactions in the game ... I should emphaize this. You pay 50 euros dollars what have you for a game that isn't as advertised, isn't complete yet and to customize your character you need to pay even more money. (full character customization can cost upwards of 40 to 30 euros) This is simply scummy no other word for it, now to the actual gameplay.  Gameplay wise the game shows it was pushed out way to early, there is game there but it runs like a car that has been shot several times in the engine. Sometimes she runs like a charm quick and good, but most of the times she is gonna cough stutter and just plain give up. Seriously I am happy when I get 10 frames, sometimes I get 30 but when the battlefield gets big and lots of things happen I just run out of frames. I think this has to do with the optimization and the servers, if rumors are true there are no EU servers or very few. Now I don't know about this but I will state that these issues can't just come from optimization alone. The game has vechiles in it, three in total though 1 type only appears in a siege mode map. They are transports that serve as spawn points, tanks with autocanons ... that aren't impressive against other tanks and the last is the siege gun which is the only one with some kick behind it. Why mention them? Because they controll like our shot car! They detect every little bump and it bounces them up and down like crazy! Can't even go straight for five seconds =/ Oh and dont get bumped into by another vechile while the frames are bad, you might get launched upwards happened to me once could happen again. Balance wise the game also feels off ... I dunno I am not great with balance but I can tell you this game isn't there yet.  Finnaly this game should be put on early access, because thats what it is an early access game not a full release. Oh yes I know the devs made promisses, but I too can offer to turn your 50 euros into 500 euros as a promise and not do it. What I am getting at is that I am I : 'See it then believe it' kinda guy, if they fix the game up and implement all that was prommised good on them. If not well then sadly this game will die, which is unfortunate because there is a game here that can be very good but is simply not finished. I will play it for a while more but for now I can't do anything but advice you NOT to buy this game and give it a negative review. Unless your cool with waiting or love this stuff so much don't get it yet, it's not finished no mater what they say.",-1,1

What started as a promising concept was quickly turned into a lobby based game I wont even call it a FPS/Shooter even though the devs have said thats what it was supposed up until the last patch 2 days before launch it said Great Shooter Experience as you logged into game. What you will find is the game plays like a Call of Duty Knife Map mod. Simply put because of the LORE tm.. Melee is ar better in every way then Guns.

I sprung for the season pass up front without hesitation. but there's just no getting around it... Fallout 4 is a tremendous disapointment. What you have here is a very pretty open world exploration game with improved gunplay at the cost of virtually no depth or replayability. Everything seems half-♥♥♥♥♥ or incomplete. Every conversation tree is essentially irrelevant, with conversation choices almost always leading to the same result no matter what you choose. Locations that look like they were intended to be interactive or story elements go unutilized. They develop this heavy base-building mini game that leads nowhere but to the occasional mission of 'kill X ghouls/raiders/mutants at Y location.' Character progression doesn't matter as you have infinite levels with which to earn whatever perk you need. There are no hard choices beyond deciding which faction you're going to side with to determine which endgame cinematic you'll get (Mass Effect 3 anyone?). All I am left with is the hope that the DLC will somehow rescue this clunker.",-1,0

4899386,377160,Fallout 4,"I did not find this game very enjoyable. I tried to get into it a few times and it just did not happen. I think it is due to the dialogue options being absent. I was never really huge into the first person shooter format. I did however, play the death out of Fallout 3 and New Vegas. I suspect due to the above, with them being more RPG inclined.   I cannot recommend this game, as it did not have the soul of Fallout, in my eyes. The potential really is there, but I should not have to mod a game and make dialogue options outside of the core game to make it enjoyable.   If you like FPS games though, this one does alright. Good environment and survival mode is interesting.",-1,0

4900312,377160,Fallout 4,"The most dissapointing Bethesda title to date  Fallout 4 is an okay decent game, if you just looking for a causual shooter with some few nice elements like some nice weapon mods and some good side quest now and then  The pros  Nice weapons customasation  Before the 'M' was added to save files it was nice with mods  The gameplay is working fine and the addition to being able to control when you wanna make a critical hit is awesome  The where actually some decent story with some of the faction quest  But sadly the cons made me never wanna support future Fallout games if they continue like this  The cons(might contain small spoilers. So please don't continue to read if you don't want to be spoiled)  The fact that the removed neutral, good and evil from the game is to me the biggest mistake Bethesda have ever made to date.   The fact that almost none of my choises had any clear visible and clear changes to the game exept for a very few exeptions.  The fact that the games lore decides that npc's tells you about lore details if you derail to far from the main quest line and just wanna do sidequest.  The problem with lack of Lore in this game is there are a lot lack of lore content. Especially in the beginning where the story seems to not care of the fact that  yourself, your wife and child are no by no means affected by a giant nuclear blast. I for one am very disappointing by the lack of freedom of choice in the end  and the way you are forced to use dogmeat in the quest. This is the first Bethesda game that made me refuse to complete the game.  The settlement system works okay, but here comes the sad fact which goes for most of this game IT'S not funny without mods  What made me play this game for more than 80 hours was due to mods, and that is the sad fact that made me lose my faith in Bethesda ever making a decent lore friendly fallout game again  The lack of interest in make next gen graphics  The stupid forced 4 choices and most of the choices made no sence after you heard what your character sayd  The list is long and I don't want to buy the dlc's unless they are really heavly discounted and will never pre order from them again",-1,0

4901791,377160,Fallout 4,"Valve should really just cut out the middle man and change the 'did you find this review helpful' button with a 'do you agree with this review' button. Anyway with that in mind, here's my negative review of Fallout Four  Fallout Four is at worst more Fallout, but it is more Fallout at best as well  ♥♥♥♥ I like: Base building Weapon customization New armour system Streamlined cooking Give a home base early on Snow Globes having an actual effect  ♥♥♥♥ I don’t like: Giving the protagonist a voice / backstory is not a problem on the first run through, but later on I will want to play as someone besides a stock white person with a stock accent. Saint’s Row lets you pick between three voices, modulate them, and allows to use the voice of the opposite gender. Com'on Fallout, you’re getting shown up by Saint’s Flippin’ Row The Wild Wasteland perk, faction disguises, Reputation, and other mechanics from New Vegas are gone. I guess you could say... what happened in Vegas, stayed in- alright I'll go away I’ll have to play through New Vegas again but I recall being able to walk five feet in any direction without getting attacked Main menu music is much lamer. Indeed, both the original score and licensed music seem to be lacking, at least when compared to New Vegas and let’s stop beating around the bush, where’s my Dean Martin damn you?!  Barbed Complements The jolly realistic graphics make it more ridiculous when animations ♥♥♥♥ up, the camera clips behind walls. Similarly the jolly pretty water engine makes it more ridiculous when water flows directly out of river banks Lockpicking and hacking remain identical to previous installments Bullet crafting seems to have been removed but I’m not going to cry over that, much as it sucks to no longer be able to load coins into shotgun shells. Come to think of it, faction money seems to have been removed as well, another thing I’m not going to cry over   I guess my biggest problem with Fallout Four is that I found the game boring. While the world is jolly pretty and Role Playing solid, ultimately the gameplay comes down to ‘Shoot the Dude.’ You shoot the dude, and then you shoot more dudes. There is no indication of why or to what end you are shooting dudes. Maybe it’s residual aversion to violence carried over from my years of being a Nintendo fanboy, maybe I’ve shot enough dudes to last a lifetime, or maybe the game is just dull. Did not finish  The framework is here for a great game if the narrative and shooting weren't so dull. I am holding out hope that in a few years Obsidian will come back and bail out Bethseda's dumb ♥♥♥ again. Like they did with New Vegas. DID I MENTION THAT NEW VEGAS IS A GOOD GAME",-1,0

4905992,377840,FINAL FANTASY IX,"I'll do a full review once I've gotten a little farther. So far this is a pretty decent port. Some quick notes:  PROS: + Port runs well, no issues at all. You can be under the requirements and the game will still run fine + Music is the same as PSOne + Remastered textures and polygons are a great addition + Controller support, although I've only tested on a wired 360 controller  CONS: - While the FMVs and textures for 3D objects have been remastered, the backgrounds have not. This creates a huge contrast between the player and background quality and can be a bit annoying - Not a lot of PC options and key rebindings can only be done in game and will only affect that specific file - I believe they still kept the original PSOne framerate, so expect 30 frames locked and dip to 15 in battles  EDIT: So I bought an XBox One controller and tried to test it on this game, even after the 2.6GB update that we got and it doesn't work that well. For some reason, the controlls are really wonky because it can't use the analog stick right. That said, the game is still fine and Keyboard controlls work just as well. If you need to use a controller, make sure you have a 360 controller because I know for sure that it works well.",1,0
4906628,377840,FINAL FANTASY IX,"Character sprites are remastered but the backgrounds are not. It causes a really jarring and distracting effect on the game. I sincerely tried to look past this, but coupling that glaring issue with the fact that combat is PAINFULLY slow I cannot recommend this port.   Yes I am aware that there is a speed boosting feature, but you have to pause the game, hit R1, then unpause to resume. Had they just allowed you to hold R1 to get the speed boost when you wanted it (when waiting for combat commands to complete or ATBs to fill for example) then it might have compensated for the slow combat.",-1,0
4906689,377840,FINAL FANTASY IX,We'll it seems they messed up big time with the controller use. I doubt they will even get a patch within any good time frame.

4907292,377970,Void & Meddler,"The design and use of color easily drew me in. These things were fairly consistent throughout the game. There were a few points it grew to the point where it gave the effect that my vision was blurry as well as generally irritating my eyes or head one way or another. Which is why I was even more disappointed when I found out that there was no solid run function. You can run in a few areas, but never as fast as you might want to or as consistently as you might want to. I understand that they want you to take certain aspects of the surroundings in, relax with the music, but when it gets to the point you have to go through the same place several times because you missed something you didn't know was even there? Or you have to go back and forth between places since in reality there is barely anywhere to go even though it shows you lots of options? You can't help but want to go a little faster. I believe however that the inability to go at your own pace was set into the game strictly to make it seem longer overall, when in fact it is really very short. As short if not shorter than a free flash game online. Perhaps this is why there are meant to be more episodes to come? I myself am unconvinced that purchasing any further aspects of this game would be worth my time or money. The story did intrigue me at first, but the character's attitude towards everyone and everything does not vary no matter what 'path' you choose. She cares so little about everyone and everything, that I just can't feel any desire to care about her or her story. She shows no passion in her 'kindness' or in her killing. She just feels insanely apathetic, as if she's a monotone motivational speaker. She's trying so hard, but she really isn't getting anything through to me. I wanted to skip through the dialogue half the time for how repetitive it was but I forced my way through in hopes that there would be something worthwhile. The game was no where as 'deep' or profound as it was trying to be. I also had gotten my hopes up that it would talk more on transgender people or sexuality in a positive way for how it was advertised to have genders and species melt into each other? The most it seemed to say though was in one instance where the main character said she wasn't going to describe everyone because it didn't matter what they looked like? A statement that gave me mixed feelings. On one side I was happy she didn't care what they looked like but at the same time it felt like just another heartless statement from her rather than her feeling love had no bounds? It's really.

The game has a rich story and lore to it, if your like me and can get sucked into a good story based game then I highly suggest Thea.   Its combat system might take time to get used to but in the end it is stil very well thought out in how it works. In the start you might need to play each fight yourself but once you have good gear and skills under your belt you can let the characters fend for themselves in battle without guidence, yes I know its not an AI based system but still, being who you are in the game why not take liberties of playing the role?   If you play you will end up burning a lot of time so make sure you don't have other plans for the day, The night I purchased Thea I started at about 4pm and by the time I found I was out of drink it was 3am.  I am not going to say you will feel the same as I do playing the game but if you just like losing yourself in a game then give Thea a try.",1,0

4915398,379720,DOOM,The campaign is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing nearly no down time and nonstop action within 5 seconds of the start of the game. The sound track is great industrial metal that as a giant metal head i love it. The campaign is everything you wanted from doom and more but sadly on the other hand the multiplayer isnt that great. Mostly due to the lack of game modes. THERES NO FFA DEATH MATCH TYPE MODES :(. every game mode is teambased and i wish the ID took their time and made the multiplayer on thier own instead of outsorucing it. While its not bad its not DOOM multiplayer and its much closer to halo than old doom or quake which is quite disapointing.   OVERALL: Campaign:10/10 Multyplayer: 5/10 go play halo or something    if you are fine with buying the game for the campign its a great buy if not its just average modern fps multiplayer shooter with an amazing campaign but i wouldnt expect to get hundreds of hours out of the multiplayer like many fps.  PS.  Preformance wise it seems to run well on Nvida stuff from what ive seen but im running an r9 390 which normaly destroys games even at 1440p but it couldnt run at stable 60 with low 1440p or ultra 1080.

4916644,379720,DOOM,"*Note: this is only a review for the SP' I didn't know how starved I was for a nervous, brutal, old school shooter until I started playing DOOM and finished it in a little over a weekend. Thought I'd paced myself better than this but hey, apparently it was too much fun to play anything else.  The core gameplay is great, the level design is generally solid, the visuals are pretty awesome if a bit on the generic side of things (which is fine because it's DOOM and it's not pretending to be anything else). The glory kills I was very skeptical about but I found myself enjoying them over the course of the game, they're satisfying and visceral and fast so they fit surprisingly well. The story serves exactly the purpose it should for a game like this: get you to kill demons, nothing less, nothing more, and doomguy is the best silent protagonist I've played in a while.  Negative points are levels that can be confusing at times in their layout, an upgrade system that feels bloated and mostly unnecessary and oh yeah, I would've taken more of it, like a few hours more.

4918072,379720,DOOM,"I have been playing the original doom games, custom WAD's, Brutal DOOM mod for over half of my life. Hearing about this game and knowing it was on its way is the most i have EVER been hyped for a game in a damn long time. I have to say on the singleplayer side of things, it far exceeded my wildest dreams. The map design is incredible and the playstyle is innovative and something not really seen before in todays game market and it works hella good.  I was pleasantly surprised watching the SnapMap reveal at E3, i had played a lot of HALO Forge back in my console days and was more than welcome to give this extra content an open mind. However im not sure if it was just me or the presentation of snapmap but it really was not to my liking, but im accepting that thats 100% my opinion, yours may be different. I just found it very hard to understand even with youtube tutorials and the end result of custom maps disappointing. Also 95% of the published maps made by other people are much the same, not even coming close to the campaign which i was desperatley looking for a replacement after playing it multiple times.  Now, multiplayer is the only thing that really pisses me off about this game and where i feel they mucked up. It seems that nowadays, all developers and companys care about is money and popularity, where are those two things at right now? Consoles. An inferior platform thats held many titles back on pc from becoming much better than they are. So how does this affect DOOM? Besides Arcade Mode which admittedly is a nice feeature, there has no been no singleplayer content and not a solid hint about any upcoming singlepayer content. All DLC has been bloody multiplayer modes and new maps, because way more people play DOOM multiplayer on consoles than PC, in fact ive struggled to find games online because its that unpopulated.  So please Bethesda more Singleplayer content please, most of the pc community is not interested in the multiplayer, we want to klll new badass demons not whiney little kids.

Gasoline Powered Chainsaw barely works at times and is buggy as hell. moments where in a Brighter Tomorrow and the last check point was one of the most ♥♥♥♥♥iest times i ever had playing a game and I played ♥♥♥♥ing scooby-doo on my gamecube, its a ♥♥♥♥ game don't get me wrong but at least it isn't buggy as ♥♥♥♥.

Standing 10 ft. from a barrel, mutated guard shoot at it, you die and he lives scott free.  demon throws a fireball. doesn't hit the hell knight, Oh no sir no no.

FOR THE LOVE OF GOD ALLOW THE ABILITY OF NO COLLISIONS. this ♥♥♥♥ is notorious for killing me every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time. spent three ♥♥♥♥ing days trying to beat one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ level because it's so buggy as hell. Plus iD Software, ALLOW THE ABILITY TO BIND A RESET KEY TO LAST CHECKPOINT DURING THE CAMPAIGN, i would think this would be already implemented. but no its not sadly.  Oh and the stupid trailer saying that this game is the 'best ♥♥♥♥ ever',. please don't believe that for this game. because probably back then the past Doom may have not been so buggy and actually fun but this rehashed crap don't cut it Id. it doesn't. Maybe I'm being super salty right now and I'm probably am but I haven't been this pissoff because of a game in a long time like almost a decade.  The Multiplayer  besides the singleplayer. the multiplay brings the classic quake feel to the game which is pretty good. has a very small progress progression compared to otherstuff and doesn't really have much to unlock except for the colors which depending on your taste you make only like a few.  the communility is pretty ok. They're mostly on Team Deathmatch which gets boring pretty fast if your playing solo but with friends can get fun.  The Snapmap  Snapmap, i may butcher it horribly, is semi meh. its cool that you get to make mods and some you can do with your friends as well. but there is barely some good mods out there. it's just that not a lot of people making them anymore.   To rate this game as a hole hmm probably a 2/5 to be professionally honest. i love quake i played it before but id ♥♥♥♥ed it up for me with this bomb.  To a personal note to Id, instead of a dlc that gives you 'new stuff' to do. just give a lot of bug fixes and ability for people to have more control of the game like more keybinding power.  ",-1,0

The arsenal is kind of limited but not ♥♥♥♥ either. You have very cliche weapons but the weapon mods you pick up thru out the game really make up for the weapons. The story's there kind of dull but has some interesting characters and environments such as a bloody minding corporation building all the way to hell.

4956056,381210,Dead by Daylight,"I like the game very fun and unique idea. It was very annoying as killer as most survivors would troll you and abuse windows/crates to no end. Since the patch I've seen less of this although I do play survivor mostly. Plus the devs say they are still trying to buff the killers....pretty soon they'll have Michael Meyers too!!!! Glad to see devs keep working on the game and keeping it relevant. They are definitely going to have to compete with Friday the 13th...I'm gonna play that game also...overall I would give the game 8/10. Only complaint is not enough content...needs more maps, killers..maybe survivors but mainly needs more maps.",1,0

4957448,381210,Dead by Daylight,"Hello everyone!  To be honest, first thing I'd like to say - that the game is nice. Really, its great idea to make simulator of a killers and victims. Plus for idea, plus for the picture and characters. Some of the killers creepy as ♥♥♥♥, thats right.   So, why I marked this game as 'not reccomended'?  1. game required a lot of work on it. Unnormal amount of bugs in game, for example ' hits for killer not always hit when it must to. You sometimes may stock near the tree or rock and etc.' Too much, trust me.  2. Absolutely disbalanced matchmaking.  When I started play this game it was usual thing to get in my game players with high rank and a lot more in-game hours. Not only me faced with this problem, but my friends as well, which start this game after me. It is really annoying to face such players, especially, when your are a new one.   3. Disbalanced locations.  There a lot of imbalanced locations, when killer never can catch skilled surviviour, such as windows in several houses, bread combains at farm and etc.   4. Strange ranking system.  This ranking system is awful- unbalanced and weird. You may done nothing for surviviour, but you ll get high in rank if you escaped. But for killer- you may kill 3 of 4 - and you loose rank.  So, at final, the game is nice, but these problems completley spoil the game for you.",-1,1
4957543,381210,Dead by Daylight,"The Halloween DLC really tipped the survivor/killer balance in favor of the killers to such a degree that the game isnt even fun to play anymore (unless you only play killer). I dumped 200+ hours into the game before the last DLC but now have no intention of playing until The Shape is fixed (which the devs explicitly said wont happen). the lopsided balance combined with a terrible matchmaking system, no matchmaking ping limits,no dedicated servers, and toxic/whiney players makes for a pretty miserable experience...especially for newer players. hopefully the devs can get their ♥♥♥♥ together and fix the damage they've done.",-1,0
4957993,381210,Dead by Daylight,"Great concept that with some more work can be a great game. The killer side of this 4v1 game is too easy, after a while you notice the same strategy is used every game (get one and wait around). The game is multiplayer but it never feels like you're actually playing with other people. You can't communicate and once one is taken they're written off (due to the strategy of the killer I mentioned).  Hopefully the devs work these kinks out!    What it needs:  - Mic use with proximity. So if you find a survivor you can talk (but not too loudly or the killer will hear). That could add some strategy and feeling of multiplayer.  - Better methods of saving survivors once taken",-1,0

Once, this went on for 30 minutes until i just gave up. ive spent about an hour on this game and sadly half of that time has been spent waiting and trying to find a match, this cant be exceptable for a game that doesnt offer much for a kind of big price tag.",-1,0

4960091,381210,Dead by Daylight,"Cool game but lack of in game coms, etc. not good generally its a group of people playing together, that join as a prematch the killer will most of the time loose, rarely ever will u win if your the killer generally u get to kill one or 2 per match but most likely will not get more then that unless they really bond. Good for 20 bux though. Survivors just get to much too many chances to get away and they can disable your hooks, traps etc.",-1,0
4960289,381210,Dead by Daylight,"Thanks for reading this review, I'm unsalted, meaning; I don't really care what other think or what they majority thinks is right, I always write reviews based on my own experience;  I Played it during a free to play weekend, I love co-op games with my friend, and convinced him to get it too, with a BIG shot of buying it.  The game has a unique concept, 4 vs 1, survival mode, no weapons, no hero's running around at survival mode, seems like a unique mode; yes it is. this concept deserves 3 out of 10 votes.  the 4th out of 10 votes, is the graphics, the gameplay etc, it's not bad, looks friendly, adjusts friendly etc.  4/10  5 out of 10 is that the community seems rather ok...  But I'm sorry for the dev's, but more than 5 is not reachable.. Out of respect I've named the top +5 points, simply cause I think this game has a lot of potential.  Con's  - 0; The killer just camps in front of your effing face, looking like and idiot, you die, and the rest wins, where is the bloody teamplay?  -0; why can't I communicate in ANY sense with my teammates (point when I'm on a hook for example?).  -0; bugs; stuck, glitching, annoying etc.   Because you don't reward the guys being hang as BAIT, you risk the HUGE chance of other people snitching, this is just lame, there is no form of teamplay, don't make it a bloody co-op game, if you don't support co-op AT ALL.  -0 I save the worse CON for last; balance!. Some killer characters are HUGELY overrated, and non-the less over powered. When you look at the bloody community everyone replies you shouldn't whine or whatever, you just ask information.  For now my conclusion is rather simple;  The game concept is brilliant, the community and the supporters of the communty give it a grey angle, when you continue looking and playing, it has a HUGE black angle. Save you money for now, or the developers should promise an improvement. It feels like a game that is in EARLY ACCES!.  Personal message to the dev's;  - Please mind the critics, they have an idea of what a good game should be. - Please consider a cleansing of the people 'supporting' your game and giving all sorts of answers that doesn't fit any sort of context. - Also; you have a golden concept! - you made a pretty good game, please balance it a little better, camping of the killer at the hook, should be forbidden, or at least have a goal for the survivor hanging there.  I Have to say the game is nice, and definantly on the right track, but it needs some perfection! Dev's; listen to your community. ",-1,0
4960295,381210,Dead by Daylight,"Interesting concept ruined by buggy lobby with people constantly leaving which resets the clock another minute.  In game load times that are longer than most games last which is really annoying. Once a game does finish loading half the people have dropped or left.   Controls setup expects you to repeatedly smash your keys when escaping, which is an inconsiderate implentation on the developers part.  ",-1,0
4960382,381210,Dead by Daylight,"First of all i like the idea of the game and it could be a great game, but .. it isnt .. idk maybe the 4 vs 1 is just not working but the game is unbalanced like hell.  If u only want to play Killer u can maybe buy this game, but when u want to play surviver dont buy it. 90% of the time u get a killer that is camping at the hook the whole time and u cant do anything, u just die and ur friends dont have the chance to save u, because even when u want to lore him away he is just face camping until u die ..  Maybe when u have 4 more friends and u get in a private lobby it makes some fun, but even with the new 'dlc' the new killer the devs just support the campers. I mean the new killer can teleport? wth now its way easiert to camp a hook and it makes no fun anymore.  Its just my opinion, if u still have some fun with the game play it but i cant play it anymore i come in a game and there is a camper ragequit closed the game havent played it anymore",-1,0
4960856,381210,Dead by Daylight,"  Tried to play dead by daylight during free weekend. Upon hitting 'quickplay' you just get booted back to the main menu, this goes on for about 30 minutes until by some miracle the game decides to put you into a match. After about 40 seconds you crash. It's literally unplayable. I mean this 100% it cant be played. I've never had any major problems troubleshooting in the hundreds of pc games that I've played, any issues I've come across I've been able to resolve fairly easily.

4963400,381210,Dead by Daylight,"This game can be fun when your teammates actually decide to include themselves in teamwork. Horrible players will in-turn make a game horrible.  Pros: -Atmosphere -Randomly generated maps -Easy to understand the game (very easy to play this game without help (i.e., the tutorial)) -Wood pallets + Killer stun -Lootable chests (you keep the loot if you live) -Generator Map item (very handy item) -Perks (Self-Heal is amazing) -Trailing system to help track Survivors -You don't lose your consumables during private matches -Character leveling and progression system -Item add-ons -Multiplayer Queues  Cons: -The absolute lack of teamwork and help is this game is so bad that it has given me full blown terminal super AIDS. -No in-game communication (excluding pre-game chat box) -Lack of graphics control in the settings -Can't adjust the music and sound effect levels separately  -Skill check can be slightly laggy -Random game disconnects even on good internet -Flashlight is horrible -Ranking system isn't consistant -Lobby hopping  -Hook Campers  Other thoughs: -What is the point of the music getting real loud during a chase/escape? It only hinders the ability to hear footsteps, groans, vaults, failed healing skill checks, closet doors being shut, Wraith snarling, and basicly any other sound that's supposed to help give away the Killer/Survivors position. -Need an incentive to continue playing after going from 4v1 to a 1v1 when 3-4 generators still need to be fixed. You get zero bonuses for solo fixing 3+ generators and living. Not really worth the time and effort to continue.  -The toolbox needs to last longer. It's virtually useless when 3-4 hooks are a stones throw away from each other. -There are a few perks that don't seem very helpful, or at least that I haven't noticed them be helpful. -Someone explain to me when the Wraith unlocked the ability to attack you while retaining invisibility. -Game glitches to the point were teammates can't be picked up and downed survivors can't be sensed  *When the game recieves more updates down the road I might adjust my review depending on what the update does*",-1,0

4989378,383870,Firewatch,"Hm... What have I just played? I guess it's called a 'story'. Well, this genre is also called a 'Walking Simulator' like there is nothing to do, but walk around... but considering how much you have to walk here it's indeed one, not in the bad way. I think it would be wrong to spoil the plot (and most likely someone in the reviews section already did that anyway), so I'll talk about other sides of a game. It's very atmospheric. Even though the graphics is cartoonish it feels real. Almost like you actually there in the woods (you won't hear background music in the real woods, though, probably). That's a tough trick to pull off.. yet they did it marvelous. Probably it is not as beautiful as 'The Vanishing of Ethan Carter' yet it's really good and in terms of atmosphere this one certainly wins. There is pretty much no action in the game, just a slice of life of a watchman living in a firewatch tower somewhere deep in the mountain forest. You will go around and talk through a walkie-talkie with Delilah (superior of our protege) and, actually, she's a nice lady to talk with, so don't mind talking to her on every occasion. After all she's working in the next tower and... it's kind of boring to sit there for days, I guess. There will be a tourists to encounter and a mystery to find out, so for you it wouldn't be like that, though. Is it fun? Well, probably not. Depends on your definition of fun.

4992514,383870,Firewatch,"TLDR version - frustratingly linear non-explore-'em-up.  I'm not really sure why Firewatch rushed to the top of the Steam charts upon release. Maybe everyone was thinking the same as me - this looks different, fun and pretty.  Well, it turns out the game isn't really much different, and the 'fun' is quite limited. Firewatch is one of those 'experience' games, so maybe I was playing it wrong in expecting there to be more. Perhaps I was supposed to be entranced by the prettiness, and the by the whole idea of being isolated in a remote tower.  I would have loved to start a collection of the things I found, but whilst there are things to find there is no collecting to be done. I was looking forward to exploring the wilderness, but more or less everything was on rails. There isn't even a jump button, and no way to step over even small obstacles unless there is a button prompt allowing you to do so.  The single level contains multiple locations connected by what are effectively corridors, steering the various gameplay tasks in a frustratingly familiar way. Various mechanisms (such as obtaining an axe) allow deeper exploration, but others (such as the torch) seem entirely superfluous.  The game seems to believe it is a work of literature. The story and setting are both quite original for a game, but that only served to remind me why most games are the way they are. The conceptual realism contained within the design was central to the whole idea, and because of that the two main characters are nicely rounded and quite human. But don't we already know what human beings are? Don't we have plenty of media to present that idea to us?  Games should be about what we as players do, giving us choices and changing the outcome.  There are interface problems too. Responding to Delilah on the radio is a timed event, so if you are using the map, or tardy in any way you will lose the chance to respond. But having watched others play I couldn't see any branching caused by dialogue responses. I think everyone is going to get pretty much the same experience.  I found the walk/run toggle to be a bit glitchy. I was using an Xbox 360 pad, and I frequently felt as though I was running through mud. Watching someone play it with M&amp;K they seemed to be getting about a lot faster.  I picked up a whole bunch of notes and letters, but was never able to read them later because the list in the menu would not scroll (again, a controller issue?)  If Firewatch is available in a sale then you might enjoy a couple of hours wandering about in the woods, but if you like a challenge or you enjoy exploring in an open world I'd steer clear even at a knock down price.",-1,0

4998765,383870,Firewatch,"All and all I have pretty mixed feelings about this game but feel mostly positive about it for the unique experience. I genuinely enjoyed the dialogue with Delilah and the plot and environment were pretty interesting. Bad marks though for a horribly disappointing ending, a few stray (but not game breaking in my experience) bugs that seem to have never been fixed since launch nearly a year ago and very short gameplay (4 hours that includes a lot of free roaming just checking out the map and looking for easter eggs).   The beginning of the game was definitely the most enjoyable for me and also when the story started to reach it's climax, but sometimes the stuff in between felt more like work and lots of running around. Which is really just fine if you like the peaceful vibe of hiking around and enjoying the environment. I found myself looking forward to the next conversation with Delilah and I believe that's the real draw to the game that keeps you playing through. Some kind of survival elements would definitely have made the game more interesting as well, but I can respect that's not the kind of game the developers were going for and it might not have fit in too well with everything else.  I give it a 6/10 and suggest you buy this one when it's on sale. I'd have been happy given it something like an 8.5/10 if it was longer and had a more satisfying ending.",1,0
4999517,383870,Firewatch,This game was excellent! It starts a bit slowly but after the first hour I was really hooked. I know some people were upset about the ending but I thought it was clever and it didn't change my enjoyment of the overall game. I haven't enjoyed a game this much in awhile.,1,0

I won't spoil anything plot wise, but if you're looking for a game where your choices matter and you have an effect on the ending this isn't for you. Also the ending if sudden, flat, and disappointing. The best parts of the game turn out to be red herrings which lead you to a far far less interesting conclusion. Also outside of the main story line the other half of the game is about a relationship you build with your only other human contact in the game. This too is ultimately unaffected by your choices and leaves you disappoint.   to be fair it was fun while I was playing and trying to figure out the mystery...but when the ending is there really is no big mystery...or WAY less so than you were led to believe AND the relationship you've been cultivating with the only other person you have contact with in the game also turns out to go no where... it just makes it all feel pointless.

5010315,384150,TeraBlaster,"For two dollars, TeraBlaster could've been a steal. It has the ground work of an awesome game. Fast, frenetic, and a nice overall aesthetic tone really seperates it from the normal schlock that appears out of the blue on here.  It's a shame then, that I saw all the content the game had to offer within the first minute of playing.  No time attacks, no score attacks, no enemy variety or weapon power-ups. There are bombs, there are speed increasers, and there are enemies. That's it. Sometimes you'll blow up and everything else will and it looks pretty cool. It's a power up I think, or a defense from the bombs. That's it. Your gun is always the same.  It further digs its own grave by having no other enviorments, or even a score in general. Its survival without any incentive for surviving.   TeraBlaster is a one-dimensional game on a two-dimensional field. It's basically a PB&amp;J without the PB&amp;J. They have the foundation, but they don't have the ingredients to actually make it enjoyable. Calling it a micro-game is no excuse for a complete lack of content, and it is even less of an excuse to demand $2 for something that can't even include a second game mode or a leaderboard.   To put it simply, this game is unfinished. There are far worse offenders on Steam that sit at full price for something unplayable, but that makes TeraBlaster all the more tragic. It was so close to being a fun and addicting Geometry Wars style shoot-em up, and yet the very step that could've made it worthy of the measly $2 pricetag was ultimately ignored, and so instead it became nothing at all.  What a shame.",-1,0

Unfortunately it is quite far on the wrong side of difficult (i.e. brutally so) that it manages to be completely unfun after a few attempts. You really cannot get anything done and sit and enjoy the actual game because you are always so close to death you are struggling just to stay alive, and this really does drain any enjoyment out of the game. Add to this the fact that the game's mechanics and design mean little failures soon spiral way out of your control and what we have here is one of the hardest game's I've ever played.   The game is absolutely crying out for an easier difficulty setting to allow the player to get much further in before going on to try 'proper' difficulty when ready, and without it I simply cannot recommend this game because as it is, it is just NOT FUN.

5018470,385330,Stray Cat Crossing,"Just finished this game after about 3 hours so here's my review.   What initially drew me in to this title was the whole presentation of it and the name: Stray Cat Crossing sounds eerie, cats have been often associated with witchcraft or some sort of evil messegers or messagers of the dead, so I half expected what this game was going to be about. Of course, I was surprised who the actual 'cat' was and how the real cat had such a trivial role. By saying that, I don't mean it in a bad way.  The soundtrack is definitely the best part of the game, it's very atmospheric and I would really be able to listen to it when I'm in need of some good instrumentals. I also very much loved the mini-animated clips when the screen would randomly turn to static; the first time it creeped the hell out of me lol; but they're very artistic.  This is a rpg mostly focused on gathering 'pieces' that make off the overall story and so, most part of the game is going to be focused on puzzles. I personally am a very big fan of these types of rpgs and this one was not a disappointment in that particular area. I had fun trying to solve the puzzles and I didn't find them particularly brain wrecking, so don't worry. Just take a bit of time and you'll manage to solve them on your own. I have to also praise the writing when it comes to the dialogues/monologues between the twins. They were, to say the least, fantastic! It really reminded me of TweedleDee and TweedleDum of Alice in Wonderland. Maybe there was a refference there, though I don't know. XD I would be able to relate this game with Alice in Wonderland for some elements, mostly because on some parts it's quite 'unique' and 'twisted'. But don't expect a girl in a blue dress and a white rabbit. That you won't get. It's more of a 'feeling'.  The thing that I'm disappointed in though, is the ending and the revelation of what truly happened. I can't exactly say why; maybe on one side I found it a bit 'trivial' and 'too simple'. There wasn't any big revelation in the ending, just didn't have enough impact to care about it properly. And it was kind of annoying to repeat the same scene at the end for like 5 times without able to at least skip on the already read text.  But overall I still recommend it. 3$ is not much, and it deserves them.   Other games like this one that I would like to recommend if anybody's interested are: Ib, Mad Father, Witch's House and the Crooked Man.",1,1

The game runs fabulous for me but I keep V Sync on to stop 3452 fps coil whine from getting out of control.  Pros to this years offering? Improved CAW, though masks and facepaint still leave a lot to be desired. Slightly better visuals than last year on PC. It's a Triple A wrestling game on PC!!! Game mechanics are improved over the b.s. that was 2k15 (even though I liked that title too)  Cons? the CAW voice can not be changed and the voiceovers and dialogue leave a LOT to be desired. Rivalries, while pretty cool, are super repetitive especially in the early stages of your career. It takes literally for ever to get to main event status (at least in my experience thus far).  Overall the game is really well designed in my opinion, and being able to download smarky ♥♥♥♥ from the 2k creations hub thing is great for any fan of the actual business itself. You can also download and run some pretty well put together CAW's from the hub who look like new WWE additions, or some other indie faves or past wrestlers who did not make it in.

Having played tons of RTS games it only took me about an hour of gameplay to say this wasn't the game for me. The game is too simplistic by itself and somewhat dull. There is no tech tree, just build the prerequisite building and you’re good to go. There are just two resources: power and metal. The built-in AI is laughable but can be upgraded with mods. Waging battles feels like a chore. Ground units move so slowly but at least you can build teleporters. This is a pure meat-grinding game that is won by building more units than your opponent with some spice built in with the use of orbital units and planets as sacrificial lambs to destroy your opponent. The game just feels like it is more glitz than actual content.  A great comparison of a game that does the meat-grinding system right is AI War. With limitations of resources, ships, and a devastating AI the game is amazingly enjoyable. With Planetary Annihilation… it’s just all grind, no thinking.",-1,0

You always have to zoom in and out to realize where your units are. Okay, quickkeys are nice. But after 20 minutes I cant remember which of the 10 constructionunits I parked where on which planet. It's simply too much to do at the same time, with units that look simply all 'blue' at first sight.

5033198,386690,Fantastic Contraption,"A fantastic experience as an intro to the Vive (pun intended).

Not too intensive on the GPU either. Good fun!",1,0

5034749,386940,Ultimate Chicken Horse,"This game is fun. How much fun? Well, I don't have any friends that play this so I have to play online matches. At least a third of the online matches fail somehow because the online beta or whatever is buggy as hell. But I still recommend this game because the times when it does work are awesome. That's how much fun it is, you should buy it even though 30% of the time your match will fail somehow. Chicken/10",1,0
5037238,387240,Steel Rain,"I was supplied with this key by the developer, this however did not affect the review.  ═══════════════════════════════════ OVERVIEW  In Steel Rain you command a lone spacecraft on missions against an artificial intelligence enemy to free planets for humans to settle in. During missions, you have 3 different attack modes, each with their own strengths. For example, one attack mode fires and has a wide spread, however it cannot deflect missiles like another mode can. Different colored power-ups during gameplay also give you other bonuses, such as regenerating shields or missiles. In between missions, you spend the money you earn on upgrades or developing the planets you have freed from enemy control. There are 7 planets to free with 3 levels each (boss fight on the 3rd) and a difficulty setting you can modify at any time on a 0-10 scale.   ═══════════════════════════════════ PROS &amp; CONS  Pros: Nice mix of bullet hell and RPG mechanics Detailed tutorial explaining the game mechanics at the beginning Adjustable difficulty setting along with a 'hardcore' mode Very smooth performance  Keyboard, mouse, and controller support  Cons: Not much story involved in the game, apart from the intro Sometimes enemy projectiles are same color as the background (blue bullets against blue sky) adding artificial difficulty Lots of grinding to level up and buy upgrades! Lack of enemy variety ═══════════════════════════════════ SUMMARY &amp; FINAL RATING  Solid game for fans of the Shoot em' up genre. Leaderboards, along with varied difficulty settings will add a lot of replay value to the existing long single player campaign.  ═══════════════════════════════════ For more recommendations on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group reviews   here  ",1,1

Now that I've played it and finished it (cause it takes 5-10 minutes to finish it) I think to myself why everyone gave this geme a thumb up (because you can hardly find a game on steam that doesn't have a positive reviews! like every games are masterpieces!!!!). I really don't get it. Anyway, this game is about 5 last minutes of a young man that going to suicide. but if you think it's gonna be special and mindcatching then you're wrong, because this game won't give you much information about this suicidal sad protagonist and why he thinks he should hangs himself, the house is almost empty and there isn't anything to do besides the game objectives (the only thing you can do is to unlock a secret door, and unfortunately there isn't much information behind that door either) at the end you should let your imagination handle the story of the game because the game won't give any answer and even won't make much questions either. so if you want to waste 10 mins of your life to play it and waste another 10 mins to write a negative review, then this game is for you! otherwise just avoid it.",-1,0
5044249,387930,The Tape,"Well...This game certainly has potential. I've played way worse when it comes to horror games here on steam, honestly, specially since we've been getting a ♥♥♥♥ flood of horror games that are full of stock assets and suck ♥♥♥.  The first thought that came to my mind as soon as I started playing this game? My god, the camera effect is AWFUL. I found it incredibly disorienting and it quickly gave me a headache. The fact that stuff glows white with that effect is probably the thing that ♥♥♥♥ed me up the most. The dev thought about it, so there's a way to disable that and play the game in mostly monochrome, and the tip on the loading screen tells you about that, so mad props to the dev, maybe he thought 'Well, this is a bit overwhelming.'  Now, about the gameplay. Unlike other Unity horror games, this one doesn't abuse ear ♥♥♥♥♥♥, obscenely loud jumpscares. And that, my folks, is something that I can truly appreciate. The atmosphere is heavy most of the time, but I feel like that atmosphere quickly dies out once you see the first enemies in the game. They barely notice you, and when they do, they aren't even properly animated, they just slide through the floor. Now, this is another problem I've got with the game. It is incredibly slow. There is no way to run, and most of the time, I keep hopping around like a dumbass because it gives me the vague illusion that I'm going faster. Spoilers: I'm not.  The sound is good sometimes, and a bit unremarkable at others. Nothing too loud most of the time, just sublte tracks and ambient noises that are decent.   The game is really, really short, I finished it in about 40 minutes, even after dying quite a few times at some points in the game. (COUGH COUGH LIGHT ORBS COUGH COUGH)  Now, the minigames. Oh god, the minigames.  In Dungeons of Terror, you move through 4 cameras trying to find pages and fuel. There's torches in every camera that keep the demon girl thingy away, but they go out on their own. So, that's why you need the fuel. Now, the cameras and the fuel...It seems like they appear randomly. I finished this mini game without knowing what I was doing, I just kept rapidly switching between the gameras, and I barely saw the demon girl.   In Dark Water, you're floating above a black abyss (WIth water, I think). You can spin around in 360 degrees, and random blobs of light fall from the sky. You've got to collect them by clicking them, while you're spinning around. You're spinning around to find more orbs, and of course, to look for the huge head of the demon girl. It randomly spawns somewhere (Most of the time, out of view), and quickly starts moving towards you. You gotta find her before she gets to you, and drop a light orb on top of her to make her stop. There's a timer counting how long you've been alive, and the head keeps getting faster and faster each minute. My only complain about this minigame? You move way too slow, and if it spawns behind you after the 4 minute mark, you're ♥♥♥♥ed.  Now, Forest. My god, Forest. It's like Slenderman, same premise of collecting 8 pages while being chased by a monster (Same demon girl.). I found this mini game UNGODLY and ♥♥♥♥ing frustrating. Unlike in Slenderman, there's few landmarks, the map is quite big, and there's no road or anything for you to follow. Just grass, trees, and lots and lots of branches where you can get stuck incredibly easy. I walked around for a while and kept getting stuck on branches. I always found a way around them, except one time. I turned around....THE DEMON GIRL WAS THERE....Not doing anything. Okay? She followed me for a while while I was getting my ♥♥♥ handed to me by treant branches. And then, I reached the end of the map. And fell off the map just by  jumping....Okay?  This mini game is ungodly. I've never felt so lost in my life.  TL;DR  I don't think it's worth the full price, I got it during a sale, and still, while I kinda enjoyed this game, I would certainly not recommend this to anybody else who isn't as used to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games as I am. It's incredibly short and frustrating sometimes. But hey, I've certainly played worse before, like Despair. I do not regret the cents I spent on this game.",-1,1

Let's talk about the game, the game is the only of the four ones with real 3D graphics, the jumpscares are very well made and they're pretty scaring, even for me who played all the other three. It's very dificult though, but it's nice to play. The animatronics design are very original and they lives up to the name, mainly Nightmare. The game mechanic are very original too, I mean, hear low sounds with high volume, close doors to protect yourself, is something that no other game has (at least that I know). I know the game is over, but even for who is starting to play now, I'm sure the player will not regret having brought this game (or the other 3 ones).

5092096,39140,FINAL FANTASY VII,"Classic game, reproduced faithfully to the original, for better or worse. A remastered soundtrack would have been excellent, hopefully and easy-to-implement mod will come around in the near future.  Caveat Emptor, if you already have this game through Squaresoft- your achievements there will carry over, but there is no way to merge save files. FYI for completionists, start a fresh game through steam.  Recommended for nostalgia and long stretches of inactivity. Expect 60ish hours for a first playthrough, 40 the second and so on. Figuring out the ultimate weapons on your own is much more rewarding than using a walkthrough. However, in the interest of not missing something you only get one chance of acquiring (happens VERY often in this game), check out the 'Caves of Narshe' website for their guide on 'Missable items.'",1,0
5092212,39140,FINAL FANTASY VII,"DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!! Final Fantasy VII is one of the greatest RPGs ever made, but this version is pure CRAP! The same graphics from the PSOne, the music was changed to a crappy MIDI format, losing all the quality it had on the original release. Simply saying, this game is a cheap excuse of an ruined softhouse (Square Enix). DON'T BUY IT!!",-1,1
5093100,39140,FINAL FANTASY VII,"The game is as good as it ever was, but this is a terrible port. Mandatory Square-Enix account aside, the controller support on this version of the game is awful. I had to download a mod just to configure the buttons to match the old PS1 control scheme because for some reason the launcher refused to let me change the buttons myself despite having a menu that's supposed to let you do just that. Even then, the game only recognized the left analog stick so I still couldn't use the dpad like I wanted to.  'No problem' you might be thinking. 'I'll just use joy2key to get around it by setting the keyboard layout on the controller.' Well I tried that too, but you can't manually switch between keyboard controls and gamepad controls in either the launcher or in-game menu. If your PC recognizes your controller, then FFVII is going to treat it as a gamepad, even while you're running joy2key.  You're better off just getting the PS3/PS4 version of this instead, or even torrenting the PS1 original if that's your only option. I don't make that recommendation lightly, but the lack of proper controller support here is inexcusable.",-1,0
5093280,39140,FINAL FANTASY VII,"The best Final Fantasy is back and it looks better than ever! And the addition of achievements gives you more incentive to do things you may have skipped the first time around, like taking on Emerald and Ruby weapons!",1,0

It is a truly amazing game, and I would recommend anyone who is interested in either JRPG's or the Final Fantasy series to give it a try. Great story, great characters, fun gameplay, and a lot of extra stuff on the side to keep you coming back for more. I definitely recommend buying this game, it is worth far more than the price.",1,0

5096114,39140,FINAL FANTASY VII,Sure it's the same graphics as in the old PC-version. Also you need a square account to activate which is pretty bad. But this is FF7 - the game every gamer and especially JRPG-fan should have played. A cultural icon often referred to and still much beloved. Spiky hair! Sword! Sephiroth! Aeris! This game is so rich and the story is deep. Also if you own it on PSX like me you'll be glad the loading times on PC are much faster. :),1,0

5105020,39150,FINAL FANTASY VIII,"Final Fantasy 8  Been a very long time since I played this game back on the Playstation 1. I picked up this port of the game and chose to give it a chance considering it does have additional DRM.   For me it took a little time to get my controller to even function but I did find out what the problem was and resumed play. That was a couple days ago with a couple sessions in already. The music is a little bit off, especially when I can recall what the older PS1 port sounded like. Button layout on the controller is fine, just takes a little adjustment. Though I will say Square does need to fix a nagging controller issue that some appear to have, Including myself for a time. Also they need to avoid messing with the music tracks. Boosting GF attacks has a bit of a delay on my end and causes a few issues. Like a complete boosting reset to 75. Overall, this port is not absolutely terrible, just takes a little work and adjustment. The game itself is highly under rated in the franchise and in its genre.",1,0
5108863,391540,Undertale,The rich story and characters easily make it one of my favorite games of all times. When a game can make me feel horrible about myself for killing something that in most games is cannon fodder is a great game to me.,1,0

Toby Fox and the team definitely put their hearts into this, and it shows every bit of the way. The story is enticing, the characters are interesting, the music is catchy and emotional, the bullet hell is, well... hell, and well overall, in my opinion, Undertale is... perfect.   If you enjoy being a pacifist, spread your good will. If you want to be on a murderous killing spree, hack away. If you're somewhere in between, do as you see fit. Whatever you do, Undertale remembers, and it makes it so much more interesting.  Do yourself a favour and take yourself on a journey through Undertale. You won't regret it.

Then they are going to get frustrated they can't share their cool MS paint comic of Undertale with you and they wont invite you to their cool Undertale parties. You'll miss out on meeting that cool gamer guy/girl your friend was trying to introduce you to. You would have hit it off with them for sure but now they are with your friends cousin and they moved 2 states away so they could work on their Undertale inspired indie game.

You've still got that $10, right?",1,0
5145940,391540,Undertale,"Undertale is an emotional roller-coster ride that plays with your emotions.  The game's tagline: A game where no one has to die, is strongly present thorught the game, encuraging one style of playthrough over another. While this deliberate pressuring seems a bit forced, and a bit overbearing, like a goat mother that wants what's best for you, I can forgive it, as this is Toby Fox's first game.  The characters of the game all have their own unique personalities, themes, and attacks. Each boss character in the game is memorable. Each boss has their own gimmik as well. Some might have you just be persistant, others my actually change how the battle plays out as well.  Even the common monsters are memorable. Every monster has it's own style of attack, and personality. A personal favorate of mine, that made me laugh was the Tsunderplane. Anyone that is familiur to the term Tsundere will get it.  This game has memes, lots of them. There are even subtle refferences to other games, either in text, or musical form. Chrono Trigger, Mother, Final Fantasy VI, and Super Metroid to name a few.  The graphics of the game may be simplistic, but it leaves the player to imagine what the world looks like. But even with the simplistic style, the game's graphical asthetic can look awesome at times.  Then there's the battle system. A unique spin on the traditional RPG. Oh, sure, you can just go kill everything, but that is a sure-fire way to HAVE A BAD TIME. Your game, your choice. But if all you do is attack, then you are missing out on a major machnic of the game's combat; ACTing. You can raise your stats, and lower the stats of your foes. You can even cause foes to let up on their attacks, making them slower, or even have them heal you!  I would love to see an acting system in future RPGs. It doesn't have to be all mercy-like, but being able to mess with the heads of your foes can be entertaining.  Also, the Music, is what brings the experience all together. Those emotional moments, tense moments, and unsettling moments wouldn't be without the musical score that Toby Fox created. For someone who self-taught themselves to compose music, they did a good job. Toby even takes a nod at classic Nintendo games, with reusing melodies in multiple tracks (Dogsong, for example, has it's melody used in many other tracks, give it a listen) Also the differnt choices in sound samples is interesting. From NES-Era Chiptunes, to SNES Era samples, some from Mother II, some from Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger.  The final thing to mention is secrets; this game is full of them. However, if you are hyper-sensitive, you may never find them. As finding secrets involves playing this game, like a game. Resetting. saving in spicific spots, then re-loading without saving. Staning in a spicific spot, etc.  Heck, this game even has is't own Herobrine-like entity in it, kinda. Some may see it, others may not. It's appearence is random. But I heard that Time Traveling, can give you clues. I heard it's often reffered to as G-  Overall, it's friggen $10! It's not long, it has replayability (so long as you don't get too attatched to the game world), and is sure to be a delight. Unless you are some sort of cold, heartless, 'human'.",1,0

5148354,391540,Undertale,"The best word to describe this game is clever. This is the most clever god damn game I have ever played. It knows exactly what it is and does it well. It plays with and pokes fun at a lot of RPG elements, and then adds a twist. The game lets you decide how you want to play video games, with so many different choices in the game, which even the tiniest ones will end up leading to a joke or self-reference somewhere down the road. The battle system is unique and fun, and every single character and enemy in this game is incredibly unique. The main characters are all very likable, and I personally only found a small handful of side characters to be kind of dislikable, and most of them were intentionally made that way. The game breaks the fourth wall more than Deadpool, and in the best way. The replayability is one of the biggest in any game I've ever seen.

5164164,392000,TRON RUN/r,"Get this game! This game is simply awesome, way better than anything I imagined about it, it's way more than a simple runner, there are plenty of features that makes it really diversified, you can jump, slide, fly, run on walls, grinds on rails, fight ennemies, ride your light cycle, plus you are not on a rail that only allow you to move on fixed way with only left, middle and right like in most runners, here you can totally move freely in any direction, it's closer to a sonic game/platformer in term of moves than a runner. The game is beautiful, the art is awesome, there are plenty of levels + an endless mode with international leaderboard, you can choose your character, customise the colors, even your light cycle, and the gameplay is really satisfying, so much fun.  I heard that some people are worried about micro-transactions, but you don't have to, they are useless, for example, 5 € is for 5000 credits, and you get around 250 credit ingame doing a 2 min race, so you can definitely play the game without micro-transactions (and credits are only for bonuses, which cost 50 to 250 credits, and you can play without them).  It's also a miracle to have this game out of nowhere, since Disney seems to have gave up on the Tron licence and Tron Run/r is probably the only Tron product we will see in a long time, so if you like Tron, I really recommend you to support this game, because it's Tron, and it's great, and I want to see more Tron!  I said everything I liked, but I have to be fair, so : A few cons: - I would have liked some faster levels, better sense of speed - I have a glitch that lower the sound effects volume, happens randomly when starting a level - Leaderboards work fine for endless mode, but are super long to load for levels (like 30 seconds) - I'm not a fan of all the songs in the soundtrack, some are great, but many don't feel 'Tron' enough, heck that makes me think that some music rhythme based levels would be awesome!",1,0
5165584,39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"A top contender for one of the best-worst MMO's ever. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  FFXIV had a bit of a rough start when it first launched which prompted Square to create an end-of-the-world Event that ended Version 1.0 ( 1.23 or higher ). This event is always shown as the intro to the game in form of a fantastic CGI video with a rather sad sounding song. However, if you ask me, I dare to say that they planned it from the start as it would give them a great amount of publicity.  Here are some of my top complaints of the game. * There is no freedom. It's another Hallway-game. * The storyline is absolutely atrocious, but it does have a few gems. * It feels like work, without pay. You work, and you gain nothing.  What I mean when I say there's no freedom, is that just like FFXI it isn't an open world game. You walk from zone to zone. This was fine when it was in FFXI because of it's role as one of the first MMO's. This is  NOT  okay in an MMO of 2010+. For example, every single town is split up into two separate zones, usually as one top and one lower section. In Limsa Lominsa, this can become utter ridiculous where the lower Limsa crystal can have 20 people standing around, yet because of it's divide you'll never see any people if you are on the upper half because the lower part when watching from upper is a separate instance.  This was done I recon in order to make things run smoothly or whatever, but it's just stupid in all honesty.  This leads us into the other part. Jumping is a lie. You don't actually jump in the game - You just display a Jump animation. Let me explain: There's no true Z-axis in FFXIV that measures if you are moving vertical. If you can walk it, you can jump it. But if you can't walk it, you can never jump it. Combine this with the fact that everything is divided into zones and we find out the true nightmare of a player of the explorer type - A gilded Cage.  Which leads us into the expansion, Heavensward where they introduced flying mounts. They work differently in that they do count the Z-axis, but your jumping still don't. And the most damning fact of it all that everyone I know hate - Aether Currents. A completely, arbitrary thing that Square Enix pulled out of their asses just to spite players. If you want to fly, you better hunt each and everyone down in ONE ZONE in order to fly in just THAT zone. And the hilarious part of this is that usually when you've found all Currents, you're done with that zone so why would you ever go back to it? This makes it so that the only zone worth spending time finding them in is the Churning Mists because at least there, you can fate grind from like 52 to 60  Make no mistakes. FFXIV is work. It's not a journey to gain strength, it's just good ol' labor for everything except by the end of the day, you'll have gained nothing of true worth. You're not stronger, you're not more skillful - You're just screwed over.  Finally, and here's the golden anaconda of it all.  The storyline, is rancid. You really need to try hard to make a story that sucks this much. Just about every single NPC has a special kind of stupidity to them that's out of this world. I have heard D&amp;D players who made joke characters  still  be better than these numbnuts! And just like how Square usually makes games these days,   You are not the Hero.   People have joked around about MMO's always telling how everyone is special and they are the chosen ones and all that. FFXIV does this the opposite way. It makes you do all the work, but you are never the hero of this tale. Even after you complete a full storyline and have your fame reach the far wides of Eorzea, you're still going to be everyone's errand boy and if some special NPC shows up, they'll push you aside and go '  No! This is something I must do! I who haven't lifted a single finger since you saw me must deal with this enemy!   ' or '  No -Name-! This enemy is too strunk for us! We must flee!  ' even though you just eliminated an entire army just to get to that point.  It's like Square looked at Mystic Quest and went '  Oh man! This is amazing! Let's take ideas from this game!  '  = = =  In conclusion, I cannot recommend FFXIV to anyone. I have spent over 800 hours with the game. I've had some good moments, and I have screamed from the top of my lungs about the story. I have met friends, I got a random guy and his girlfriend to get into the game and they love it, but my hate only grew.  If you think you can stand all these things, then I implore you to try the trial out. But otherwise, I cannot recommend this game to anyone with two braincells.  PS. I am slightly wrong about Jumping, but in grand gist of it I am right. Jumping in FFXIV is largely a pointless ordeal.",-1,0

Even then, there are free mahjong solitaire games online that do more for free.  The titular 'Pretty Girls' are completely pointless, only there for horny people who can't Google porn for some reason. If you're buying it for nudity, there is none.  The gameplay is okay, it has some issues (that were fixed in the other game) that aren't that big, but for the price, the amount of content is sad. There's only one gamemode (timed) and about 50 different boards. The tile generation can be a pain though, producing unsolvable layouts on certain boards very often.  In short, there's no reason to get this. Even if you wanted to play a mahjong solitaire game on Steam with animu gurls on it, Delicious! Pretty Girls Mahjong Solitaire is much better for a fraction of the price.",-1,0
5186833,394230,Battleborn,"Look, full disclosure. I'm 'Not Recommending' the game NOT because it's not fun. I enjoy it. It's fun, especially when you play with friends. I'm 'Not Recommending' it because there are way too many glaring issues that make the price simply ridiculous. Alright? On with the review.  Battleborn is a Hero Shooter where you pick one of many characters, each with their own role to the team. There are various forms to play (which I'll go over each indivdually soon): PvP: -Meltdown; where you escort minions to the enemy base, trying to score more points before your opponent to reach a goal or have more points at time out. -Incursion: you push into enemy territory to destroy their Sentry Robots. -Capture Zones: Multiple capture areas appear, and you must control them to gain points, and first team to reach enough points wins. In total at time of writing there are 2 maps for each mode.  And then there's PvE Campaign, with multiple chapters going across the story.   In terms of raw gameplay, it plays decently well. Each character has their role, and they do it well. I personally wouldn't mind at least 1 more healer support (out of the supports in the game, only 1 is reliable at healing, others seem to be simply outshined by this 1), but other than some clunky kits character kits generally just make sense.  However that's raw gameplay. Actual interactions with the game is different.  First I'll go over the PvP: -For me, Meltdown is the only game-mode that plays well (and even then, one map feels as though it has a weird layout, but that may be just me). You have an advantage on your end of the map and need to take the risk to shove in, while maintaining general map control. It plays well and has a nice objective form, allowing every hero to shine at some point in the map. -Incursion feels like it promotes snowballing way too much. You get 2 Sentry Robots, but I find that unless you kill the opponents within a short time frame of your own dying, if you lose your outer robot, you lose all map control. This is due to a few reasons: First you lose the easy access to money and buildings. Two, you can buy out opponent buildings in their base (a non-existant issue in Meltdown), meaning that you get even more map control. Three: You get a massive height advantage which anybody who's played hero shooters before will tell you is crippling. Four: Destroying a Sentry Unit spawns stronger minions, making your push even harder, despite having to go farther. Despite the fact you are at your own base you have almost every disadvantage possible if you lose your Sentry, including you can't even take your own personal objectives (Such as mercenary camps) simply because they destroyed your first unit. Overall it feels like while it had promise there are too many issues that it makes one push a game decider even though you don't have to push far. -Capture Zones just doesn't seem to fit well into the game for me. Given that most characters are offense or hold oriented (even if they are supporting, they support the above two), it feels weird having to DEFEND and objective instead of counter pushing, in a game like this.  Now for campaign. To me it's simply a mess. The first chapter is interesting, but after that it starts getting repetitive. Out of the 8 chapters, 2 are escort missions (Because those are fun, right?) and 3 are Defense Missions (you gotta hold an area). Bosses tend to drag out a LOT, and you get a scoring system (which is needed to unlock characters, unless you wanna grind levels out to get a full roster...) that doesn't seem reliable. I could do it flawlessly and get a worse score than screwing up multiple ways for 'reasons'. In terms of a story, it's simply boring to me. The basic story is 'Rendain has drug many stars into a void, and is going for the last one that everybody is at', which is interesting, but after that you have 'We have built a machine, defend it' 'We gotta save a prisoner' 'Get this robot to the portal'... it's bland. Which is sad because they proved they had a potential for great story through the lore (which is a delight to read, let me say). The dialogue is pretty golden in the campaign, but while I get a good laugh, I find that I just... am not interested in the story which is bad for a story driven mode.  In terms of music... I can't remember even the title theme. It's suiting, not memorable music through the game.  The Gear System needs a special mention. You get gear by playing, and you can use the in-round currency to buy it to buff yourself for the rest of the round. The only problem is... you get no guarantees on what gear you can get. This means for optimal loadouts you are relying not on skill, or knowledge but rather luck. You should never have to rely on luck in a competitive game to be able to do as well as you can.  In terms of graphics, don't let the minimum requirements fool you. So many maps can and WILL cause visual lag on even pretty high end computers. It is poorly optimized, and it doesn't help when there is a large amount of visual noise making it hard to see what you are attempting to shoot at. Even a simple grenade can cause a massive fire-ball followed by a plume of smoke, and that can lose enemies more often than should. That all said, the game itself has a very nice art style overall and it's a pleasure too look at outside of fire-fights.  Matchmaking is also weird. You don't exactly 'Choose' what maps you want to play. Rather you choose a game-mode (Including Campaign), and join with people who then vote to decide which map they want to play. While not inherently a bad thing, it does NOT work in Campaign, since excluding the final chapter you are both relying on luck to show a campaign you wish to do, and then that everybody wants to do that same campaign as well.  In terms of humor this game has quirky humor, but it almost always gets a chuckle out of me. They even thought of stuff such as attempting to access certain things before you are supposed to, which is pretty clever.    Summary",-1,0

It does not have the map/story content of a full-priced, $60 game and the vs mode (which is the main reason to buy this game) is very unbalanced and needs tweaking. I wanna say that I love the guys at gear box, they know how make cool characters and hilarious dialogue, and this game is no exception to that. But really this game tries to do too much and comes just shy of all of it. I'd go into more detail, but many of the other reviews explain it much better than I can. I'll give gearbox some benefit of knowing that this is their first real attempt at serious pvp ... but that's what play testing is for, it really feels like they didn't work out the kinks in this game. So overall, don't get this game yet, wait until it's on sale and keep checking the reviews for updates, if/when they smooth out the kinks I'd be happy to re-write this as a recommendation, but for now I'd rather suggest you save your hard-earned money",-1,0
5188984,394230,Battleborn,"All I can say is...Gearbox should probably stick to the Borderlands franchise. I would rather have had a Borderlands 3 instead of this.   PvP is very unbalanced. It becomes a problem when players are able to depend on gear instead of just pure skill. So if you are fresh to the game, you will have to go on a PvE grinding spree before you can even think about doing PvP. Or else you will get steamrolled by higher lvl players in every match.  On the other hand, I enjoyed the PvE portion of this game. It is fun and you will enjoy the humor and diversity of the character skills. However, the game is pretty dead right now and you will be lucky to find at least 3 players to join up with you on a team. And trust me, you don't want to play PvE by yourself(it's boring when playing it solo). IF you have friends though that are dedicated to the game then you will probably not have a problem at all.   I think Overwatch's release screwed this game over. Some people compare the two of these games and were probably like hmmm...if I had to choose one of the two then I will go with OW. Lol because that is what I did. The only reasons I got this game is because I had a little extra money and thought I would try it out.  I can't recommend this game. In my opinion if PvP fails, then the game fails all together. A game with good PvE can only carry a game so far until it crashes.",-1,0

5189427,394230,Battleborn,"Why the hell would I continue to bother with this when I can just go play Smite or Overwatch?

I'm just glad I didn't buy the game at $70 and managed to snag it for $15 during the Humble Bundle sale.    The game's matchmaking system is purely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Instead of taking a pool of 10 players and evenly dispersing them between two teams, it matches you with 4 randoms and then grabs a group of 5 premade players to match you against. You'll wind up with games where nobody on your team is above level 10 and the entire enemy team is level 100. Some fanboys will say the levels don't matter, but they tranlsate to a better arsenal of items, a bigger cast of characters to choose from, and more intimate knowledge of the maps and their strategies.

5190115,394280,Dark Heritage: Guardians of Hope,"This game is just downright bad. I, a self-declared completionist, actually uninstalled it about 1/3rd of the way through because I just couldn't take it. Here's the breakdown: + Graphics: I'm not sure what everyone's complaining about. The graphics are actually pretty high quality. The cut scenes with video are not really my taste, but they're well integrated otherwise. Nothing to compain about here. That is, however, where the positive aspects end.  - Music: repetitive. Sooooo repetitive. - HO scenes &amp; games: either entirely too easy or way too complicated. Example: so if I have a crowbar, a hammer and a knife, I have to use the *knife* to get a boulder out of the hole in a tree? And break off the blade while doing it? Really?? And I need piece A to open a box to find piece B which opens another box to find piece C which completes a puzzle that I have to shift three pieces in to solve? Really?? - Story: The story is completely contrived and ridiculously cheesy (some strange cult on an island, a kidnapped professor), but somehow I'm not allowed to actually work towards the cult and the professor plotline because I absolutely *have* to help every NPC I meet along the way. Because reasons. Plus laughable, pseudo-cryptic, pseudo-esoteric mumbo jumbo from a talking red-winged blackbird with an incongruously gravelly voice. No real plotline to make it exciting or make me want to play, plus weird, ridiculous, pseudo-creepy stuff (I can see the developers now with a storyboard: 'Creepy things: spooky castle high on a geologically-improbable spire of rock, cemetary, tomb, abandoned mine, random skeleton in the ferry office'). I wish I could say the kitsch was amusing, but it's not. - Price: Dude, I can get 10 beers at the late night store for that and have more hours of fun than I did with this game. Hurrah for Steam sales.  Constructive conclusion: I'm a big fan of HOGA games, and of Artifex Mundi. Try one of their in-house titles instead. I recommend the Enigmatis series highly.",-1,0

5191986,394310,Punch Club,"Like many others at first I liked this game. The visuals were retro good and the references to the 90s were great. Then the grind hit the game. Everything from working out to walking/taking the bus is a grind. If you don't have enough cash you have to walk everywhere which eats up time too much. Have too much money ($200) and a street thug turns every time to take it from you. Work out every day because at the end of the day sleeping takes all the workout you just did off you so if you skip a workout then your stats go down by quite a bit. I got into the habit of working two days (and losing loads of stats) workout for a day and a half to just get back to where I was a little more, then fight and then repeat. By the way you don't control the fight. You just sit there and watch your guy lose when you on 50 health vs the other guy who is on 2 health. Somehow they hit you every time and get your 50 down to 0 yet all of your hits either miss or get blocked so the other guy stays on that magically 2 health.   I thought I got this game cheap but looking back it was way more than I should have parted with. I would say get if you have loads of time, like grind games and it only costs a very low price otherwise stay away. For you players that do buy it make sure to pick the kicking fighting style because the boxing is great but the player is always too exhasted to throw a punch about 3 punches into the fight so you lose. The other style you just take loads of hits but you have no offense so fights are more boring than normal. Go for Kick, buy home gym as soon as you can, take buses, only work as a miner and maybe, maybe you might get somewhere. I wouldn't bother there are plenty of better games out there.",-1,0
5192069,394360,Hearts of Iron IV,"I love paradox interactive games. Ck2, Eu4, Vic2, hoi3-hoi4, stellaris, mount and blade. thousands of hours.  However, they really ♥♥♥♥ed up on hoi4. We are over 4 months since the release and still the game is unplayable and if you manage to get a half-♥♥♥♥♥ game going that is somewhat balanced, the germans are always excessively weak, your allies will attack randomly and waste all their troops, equipment and manpower and accomplish nothing. They will declare wars on random countries after the war and never do anything about it.  And even if you manage to win it all, be more succesful than the allies historically, the Russians will take it all even if you own 90% of the map. In my last game I won accross the board. I won the war with all of europe except poland and finland, and everything else on the map that wasn't the, more or less, default russian borders. At the end of the game, Russia had over 4 times more points than me. Ironman game on normal.  I feel like I was scammed.",-1,1
5192289,394360,Hearts of Iron IV,"At the moment, I cannot recommend the game in its current state. It is one of the more bug-free releases from Paradox yet, which is a plus. But, the game does not feel feature complete. It seems very vapid, and empty. I have played around 60 campaigns so far through my 97 hours. I've been trying to get the same EU4/CK2 experience (or even HoI3/DH) as they had on release. The game itself looks very pretty, and can tide you over for a while, but it gets boring very quickly. Around half my hours+ are from trying mods. And now, they are already working on an expansion with paid features, with content that should have been in the game from the beginning. I don't know...this doesn't feel like Post-CK2 Paradox. This feels more like the old system they had: make a base game that's bare bones, then sell expansions which make the game worth playing.  TL;DR: Dissapointing. Feels very lacklustre overall. Definitely not on-par to EU4/CK2 at their releases.  EDIT 1 (12/28/16): It's been a while since I posted this review; a new expansion has been released since that time. The new release, titled 'Together for Victory', has been extremely lacklustre. It adds things that should have been in the game from the beginning, are simple additions that are in no-way creative, and simply down-right insulting to force as paid DLC (new option for planning).   They also have the gaul to price the Expansion the same as the huge 'The Old Gods' CK2 DLC. TOG fundamentally changing things in the game, adding tons of depth, and a whole new time period. This is just one big slap in the face for those who have supported Paradox for so long. They are going back to their old pre-CK2 practices. That is just a complete shame. I have no doubt that HoI4 will be a good game in a few years time, but it is still utter crap right now. The AI is more broken than when I originally made this review, the gameplay is stale, and everything previously stated is still true. The best part is, is that they added way more bugs than the patch/expansion fixed. Ones that cause random CtDs for people now.  I can 100% say that this purchase I made is not at all worth it. I have not played the game in months now, and have had almost no 'craving' or 'addiction' to it like with previous titles. My hours in the game were just trying to get used to everything and trying out the various mods for the game. I truly wish I would have waited (which I didn't do against my better judgement because of how great CK2 and EU4 were), and got the game at an extreme discount with a ton of the expansions bundled together way in the future. I would not have missed out on anything.  Tl;DR 2: Do not get this if you are looking for a game with the depth of EU4/CK2. This game is a major let-down, and feels like Hearts of Iron Lite. Wait until the game has had many DLC/Expansions that fix the core gameplay. And then wait for it all to go on sale.",-1,0
5192500,394360,Hearts of Iron IV,"HOI4 is a good game, and if I have to rate it I would give it 8/10 score. But some minor issues really ruin the game. If you want a game like EU4 in WW2 then this game is for you. However if you want a realistic WW2 game, this game lacks those mechanics since it doesn't focus anything about realism.  Pros: -Way easier to play when compared to HOI3. -No more annoying economic system as in HOI3 that every minute you had to change trade deals with nations etc. Trade is easier and less of a headage now. -Armies are commanded by AI (unless you change the direction manually) even though they have flaws, the army is way easier to command when compared to complex system in HOI3. -Air Force and Navy is way easier to be commanded. -Way easier to do airborne and naval invasions. -Good production system: making weapons, tanks, planes and ships etc. -National Focus Tree. -Tech Tree is better and easier to understand compared to HOI3. -National Modifiers. -Civilian and Military Factories. -Sending countries volunteers. -Map is better and more efficient. -Way easier to do Mods and publish mods.  Cons: -Thailand never gets their historical claimed territory back like Japan gave them during WW2. -No Hatay for Turkey. -Geography is wrong (50% Turkey is desert and South American geography is wrong, similar to Turkey). -Pacific Islands size were enlarged but Malta and rest of the non-Pacific Island sizes stay in original size. -Greeks have core (not even claim) over Istanbul despite the fact that they were in Balkan Pact which prohibits members from having claim to each other. -No shape or form of Balkan Pack aka Balkan Entente. -It is super easy to change countries’ ideologies with simple coups, you can make USA communist less than 1 year if random communist countries like Mongolia or Communist Uyghurs support you since USSR and Mongolia or Bhutan all has same influence power. -PP system turned the game into arcane game rather than realistic version that was used in HOI3. PP turns the game more like EU4 feeling rather than typical HOI series feeling. -Army, Naval and Air experience also turns the game into arcane game. You need “army experience” to add radios or first aid kids to your soldiers. Or you need “naval experience” to modify your ships instead of Money and Resources. -Only 1 ruler by nation instead of having accurate cabinet that was used in HOI3 representing a realistic view on government.  -Fascist Turkey is called Neo-Ottoman Empire, Fascist Bhutan is called something Dragon and Fascist Azerbaijan called Land of Fire etc. -When you promote a general into field marshal they magically forget everything they have learned. -There is only General and Field Marshall making AI just having 1 or 2 huge ♥♥♥ armies with Field Marshalls and making Generals useless.  -Only 4 ideologies, Democracy (Super Vague), Fascist (Would be nice if they had nationalists also), Communist (Would be nice to also have socialists), Neutral (It should be changed to monarchist and religious imo) -Nepal, Bhutan and any other country can make Nuclear Weapons easily given time. -We have a DLC about Commonwealth that gives focus tree to New Zealand and South Africa but still nothing about China… nor Balkans… -Soviets get to claim Istanbul, Bursa and Izmit magically by Focus Tree, but not Eastern Turkey… They can only get Eastern Turkey in something to do in German Focus tree. The one of the biggest reasons why Turkey decided to join Allies and NATO was due to Stalin’s claim on Eastern Turkey that he wanted to give Armenia SSR which ofc GAME DOESN’T INCLUDE cause Istanbul, Bursa, Izmit and even some Greek islands are for some reason magically more legit for Soviets to claim.  -Azerbaijan got no claim in Northern Iran when it is filled with Azeri population. So when they took those lands they loose half of the benefit since people of that location are hostile against them, just like when Turks who have 90% same culture takes those places :DDD, but hey if Greeks take Istanbul (which is 95% turkish in this time), Turks will convert to Hellenic race instantly :D -No Anglo-Soviet Invasion of Iran in 1941 in focus tree -Dlc's are expensive and does not add overwhelming game change mechanics.",-1,0

I wasn't the biggest fan of HOI3, and after buying it barely played due to the ridiculous amount of micromanagement, and the terrible UI. For years I stuck with HOI2 or one of many variants (Darkest Hour, Arsenal of Democracy, etc.). I had high hopes for HOI4, and the developers have delivered.  Map looks beautiful, production and logistics are easier to understand, the UI is easy and intuitive, and there's not much to complain about. If I had one criticism, it would be the dreaded end of game lag. By 1942, the CPU has created hundreds of infantry divisions which can slow the game to a crawl by 1944, even on a rig with a decent CPU. With some more optimization, I think I've found something to scratch that WWII itch for years to come.",1,0

5195243,394360,Hearts of Iron IV,This game is uneccessarily complex. Unless you have hours upon hours upon hours.... just to learn how to get the gist of this game... I'd recommend you find something else and pass on this one.    I was truly disappointed to be honest. After reading the store page and looking at the trailers I was looking forward to playing it. The tutorials aren't very well laid out... they don't really tutor you in a way that you learn... it's more like a situation where a tiny icon lights up and IF you see it.... and IF you click on it.... and IF you follow what it tells you to do.... in as frustratingly cryptic a manner as is humanly possible... you realize that it will take HOURS of real time.... before anything remotely substantial happens in the game.  One of the options in the game is to research different things... one I remember in particular was not due to be researched until 1940 (it was only 1938 at the time I wanted to research it).... I clicked to start research on it anyways thinking... why not get a head start... can't hurt right??? WRONG!!! The game applied a time penalty (who died and made them god??) which left me not completing the research until several months AFTER I could have completed it if I'd waited two years before I even BEGAN researching it! What the hell is the point of research if it's going to make gaining a new technology take longer??? So much for changing history and winning the war under your terms with what ever country you choose to be.,-1,0

It may not be fair to say the game is one of a kind, but it is definitely unique. The story, while perhaps barebones, is quite thought-provoking. There is a good selection of weapons that offer different ways to play, which is a good feature. The game is definitely short, clocking in at 7 hours for me to beat it. but that is not including all achievements and the collectables. I will definitely be returning to pick those up.

5205675,39540,SpellForce: Platinum Edition,"Spellforce does a good job of combining RTS with RPG.   RPG elements: First you start off with a low-level hero of your choice. You can be almost everything: form a simple sword fighting warrior to a mage using various spells to destroy his enemies.  Every class, like in almost every RPG, requires a different style of play and if you cannot decide which class you prefer you can combinate them.  From the start you always have a main quest active which guides you through the story and to the next map. But it is always worth it to leave the main path and look for some side quests which reward you with additional EXP and sometimes with a pretty neat item.  Now to the RTS elements of the game: On almost every map you face a hord of enemies your hero cannot deal with alone. So, you can summon workers at monuments of various tribes (humans, elves, orc, etc.) to gather ressources, build a base and produce units to help you in battle. Every tribe has its own buildings and units, therefore the gameplay with each tribe is slightly different.   On some maps you can summon up to 5 heros, who can be equiped with items. You can control this heros like your main character. So, instead of building up a whole base you play through the map with just a small group of heros.  If it comes to a big battle, you quickly lose track of some units (e.g. you heros). For these situations there is a bar at the top of the screen where you can see all important informations and available spells of your heros and get the current position. For different perspectives you can zoom in or out and rotate the map. There is also the possibility to control your hero individually in third-person perspective and via WASD-keys, which is nice to immerse more into the well designed world. But most of the time there is no advantage of this view.   What I really like aobut the game: The variety of how to skill your hero is enormous. As I already mentioned: Everything is possible from a sword swinging strong warrior to a mighty spellcasting wizard. First I played the game with a combination of healer and heavy tank which worked out quite well. My second char was a complete black mage that could be easily killed in close combat, but the enemies had a hard time reaching it.  Furthermore, the design of the many different maps is well done. Each map got its own charm and it never got boring.  What I do not like about the game: Some maps are pretty hard to beat because of huge amounts of enemies that are so strong you can only kill them by luring them away from a group and kill them one by one. That takes a lot of time and can be very frustrating, because you have a constant feeling that your character is too low leveled, although you already have done every possible sidequest and gathering a good amount of EXP at an enemy spawnpoint takes ages.  Conclusion: Spellforce is a nice combination of RPG and RTS. The urge to level my hero and to loot more and more items got me at the very first minute. Whenever I got to play with a new tribe I was curious of finding out what its advantages and disadvantages are. The story is nothing special, but it is well told. The design of the maps and units is rich in variety, so you always get something new to see. And if you bring enough time and patience to sit through a hard time completing a map, I would recommend this game.",1,0

5208324,396160,Secret Of Magia,"After playing 'Secret of Magia' for over 10 hours I must say that it has its good moments and unfortunately lots of bad moments as well.   Let's start with the pros:  -I like the fighting system, since it makes the gameplay more arcade-ish compared to the turn based RPGs.  -It has a male and female character selection, classes, armors, weapons, gathering, alchemy, blacksmithing, trading and even gambling!  -The hookshot is a nice plus! -The quest system is great as well! -The graphics are cute, especially the character close ups. -Audio-wise it has a decent soundtrack that fits perfectly to the game's concept.    So what's bad after all?  -A couple of bugs to ruin your gaming experience... For example:  http://steamcommunity.com/app/396160/discussions/0/521643320363085829/   -The enemies are leveling up according to your level! That alone actually destroys the point of leveling...   -Your character's speed gives you the impression that everything goes in fast forward.  -You are basically on your own. You do not get a lot of help from the game, in order to progress.  -I found myself spending most of the time wandering around the areas in order to find out what's next. Although, there's an in game map in certain places, that doesn't help so much. I would rather have it accessible everywhere in the game after pressing the M key.  -There's a quest where you get the following coordinates 'X33 Y24', but there's not any coordinate indication in the game to get an idea where you have to go.  -You cannot save the game anytime and anywhere you want. -I wasn't able to switch into windowed mode until I found out in the game's discussions that you have to press the F5 key to do so. Also, Alt + tab doesn't work.  -Minor spelling issues.  -Lazy ending...

5211302,396790,Dracula's Legacy,"I had been playing this game for about two hours when it glitched and made it impossible for me to finish. Judging from walk through's on YouTube, I'm almost at the end of the game, but frankly, it's just not good enough to play it through again and finish it, and it's not just because of the glitch.  What Hidden Object Games lack in tense game play they should make up for in plot and appealing settings to explore. The plot just wasn't there in this game. Voice acting was poor, and the combination of 3D graphics (which had all the fidelity of a PS1 cut scene) and hand-drawn elements just did not mesh together well. The game was not enjoyable to look at, nor was there really any reason to care about the story and its characters.  The game play itself was fairly par for this type of game, including the annoying habit of the character throwing away items between screens for no discernible reason (Why would you ever get rid of a crowbar? They can be used for so many things) and needing items when you know any normal person would complete the task with their hands. That may be part of the charm in these kind of games for many, so I wouldn't necessarily call it a detriment, but certainly nothing new is brought to the table.  Simply put, there are plenty of better Hidden Object Games out there.",-1,0

5225778,399070,Dragon's Wake,"I really hesitate to recommend this game for a single reason--the final boss. But before I go into that, here's my thoughts about the rest of the game.  First off, it's got a cute art style that while pixelated is easy on the eyes and still manages to convey a lot of character detail. Starting off as a newly hatched dragon and learning the ropes through solid tutorials both obvious and subtle was nice as well (for example, the game has 'Press Z to jump' printed on the wall but also has lighted crystals in certain parts to show you a glide and jump path). It feels natural to play, and the controls are decently responsive without being twitchy.  There's a definite sense of progression too, as you upgrade your jumping/gliding, health, and fire breath via in-game creatures, many of which are hidden in areas you'd miss just sprinting through the game. Plus, as you progress, you'll grow larger in size, which seems to upgrade your jumping height by extension. While it was disappointing to not ever reach the size of an adult dragon, it didn't really take too much away overall.  The enemies are fair and easy to figure out once you've run into them a few times. Most of the creatures in the game are passive, although later on you'll run into beasts that will aggressively approach you on sight rather than meandering around or only attacking when you're close enough. Discerning what will hurt you on contact (bats, for one) and what won't is trial-and-error, but it comes quickly and easily enough.  Now for some complaints. I felt some aspects of the branching story (which really only branches into 'Lonely Ending' and 'Hero Ending') were not obvious the first time around, and felt a little too obtuse. The enemies could be frustrating at times, especially during the first 'boss' when a bunch of ranged and melee enemies would swarm you. Luckily it was never too overwhelming; but it never felt challenging in a good way, just annoying.  Which brings me to the boss. Apparently, his difficulty was increased at some point in a quiet update. I only just got the game so I cannot confirm this, but from reading forum posts and guides it seems his attacks are much faster, more responsive, and therefore more difficult. However where it runs from 'challenging' to 'rage-inducing' is when this difficulty runs into a few before-this minor problems with the controls and gameplay.  For one, the boss cannot be defeated with your fire breath and fireball attacks alone. You need to learn to effectively use the 'ground pound' attack, and dart in and out during certain attacks. The problem here is that the controls can be somewhat clumsy, especially with the jumping and ground pound, making the first phase of the boss a test in praying the controls respond and good ol' luck (hoping he'll stay on the lower level, letting you pound stone blocks onto his head without taking too many hits instead of jumping up to slash you or spamming his AOE attack). Where before the unresponsiveness would mean losing a heart to some skeleton or goblin, now it means forfeiting at least two or three hearts to a rapid-fire assault of sword slashes.  The second phase isn't much better, but in hindsight it's more about taking the shots you can in between dodging around his hyper-fast and jumpy movements. It took me about 20 tries, quitting, taking a break, and then coming back in a single attempt to beat the boss. It's all about keeping yourself alive more than dealing damage.  Then, after you've finally managed to beat his second stage, the boss comes back for one last go, where he chases you at lightning speed slashing away. Basically at that point it's all about jumping and mashing C, and just hoping you've got at least 8-10 hearts to work with as he cuts you to pieces as you attack.  Then, you're done. And unfortunately as much fun as I had with the first 90% of this game, the ending battle really soured the experience for me. But you should pick the game up and experience it for yourself. It's a fun little game that won't take long to beat at a more than reasonable price point.",1,0

It was way too hard and the maps were terrible. Now, after the update, the game has improved greatly. The enemies are easier and more balanced. The game looks better. There are new maps.

5283243,402040,The Guest,"Short and Unsatisfying. The puzzles are fairly easy, or can be brute forced without much difficulty, and there are lot of loose ends with no real lead up or resolution, and the twist is unexpected but akin to finding out at the end of Myst that the main character was a Lizardman, out of nowhere and lacking any real connection to any of the previous elements.  I never actually knew or cared about why I was Leonard, why a game set in 1986, of all times, has some futuristic trappings, and while you get to see a glimpse behind the curtain of the room trap, it goes no further than that and you're railroaded all the way, barring some obscure hidden puzzle.  Puzzle solving at it's core is hunting for random stuff in the dark, and most of them are red herrings, so much so there's a cheevo for grabbing all the crap, which makes inventory management a little hard. I wish I wasn't being so dead honest about the nature of this game, it is nothing but finding junk in the dark, and finding ways to turn on the light so you can find said junk, and then using it to solve a puzzle.   I guess a good way to put how the ending makes me feel, is that I didn't really feel indoctrinated- Bioshock and White Night made you realize that you'd been playing to someone else's rules all along and hadn't noticed it, whereas this game's antagonists have a very low bar for conversion. I guess if you can solve random puzzles that have no interconnection or deeper meaning, you're okay enough for them, I guess?   Worst part is that if there's room for multiple endings, and I just got a bad one, two puzzles are so full of tedium, the lazy maze I could have coded in my sleep, and the one involving rotating 3D objects to form a 2D puzzle, which are slow, and imprecise, I'm not even interested in going back to the beginning to try something new, which I doubt exists, as the game is very linear. Even found a bug when I hit 'continue' after beating the game that had me back in the locked room, with buggy access to my inventory, and forced to sit through the unskippable credits again.  Save up your money and maybe try something a bit more groundbreaking, like Layers of Fear or something.",-1,0
5284033,402300,Dungeon Manager ZV,"The game is 'fine'. Don't expect flashy graphics, this wasn't made to have them.  Sadly the content is also simply lacking though. Completion can be expected to be done within 10 hours. I currently feel no need to go back to this game.  Suggestions: Customising the monsters: currently they level up and gain a little defense and health, i'd like to see multiple target hits, instant kill abilities and to be able to see more than just 'Level, hp &amp; defense' Would like to see a 'campaign style' play. Although not really sure if it'll work for this. Ability to have more than 1 dungeon at a time. Given this isn't a competitor to other dungeon design games and is meant to different, i think this is a way to make it different. (by this i mean having some form of overworld view and being able to buy new locations(possibly with maximum depths and maximum level of adventurer?) Make it 5x5xX, this then allows for more complex dungeons Cap's on the resources are very low, a lot more could be done with it. An 'easy' way of levelling weak monsters so that you can combine them would be good (preferably using a second dungeon?) or just simply pay for levels with resources? heck the resource is basically 'souls of dead adventurer's' so them being able to give exp isn't too much of a leap of faith. Eventually you just basically get adventurer's to go to 9 depth asap and just kill them there, make nearer to the surface more useful? Allow monsters to evolve naturally instead of forcing combines to make them better Needs just simply more fusions and more creativity with what they can do.  Plus sides: I experienced no bugs. (one or two bits where the text didn't fit) Simplistic - Was very easy to work out roughly what to do.   6 hours is still more than the other reviews and as i stated, i've literally finished it. Would recommend at 99p. But at this amount you get too little. Most games on kongregate have more content than this.

Also no ranked mode without money, which means EVEN less maps. Free to play feels like a glorified beta, meaning you don't have features that should be there... Reminds me of SW:ToR, while technicly it is free to play, it's not really enjoyable without money.  As a free to play game, I would not recommend it.",-1,0

As most of the recent games I have played achieved 50-60 FPS on medium or higher settings, I consider Dishonored 2 currently unplayable. Additionally, there appears to be excessive and inconsistent mouse lag. Though that is more or less resolved by limiting the number of pre-rendered frames to 1.   I cannot evaluate the gameplay or story due to these issues. Hopefully the upcoming patch will resolve them.

I observed some texture problems e.g. when the wall and the floor meets, there are sometimes a white gap, which is a bit disappointing, but not very disturbing. You get the absolute mood of the first game with better graphics and a great story. So nothing special, that a patch couldn't solve, so I can just recommend this game.

5300907,403640,Dishonored 2,"First the conclusion, you should buy this game but not today, maybe after a few weeks due to several technical problems.   After playing the first 2 missions i have to say that this game is almost perfect, everything: from the narrative (tone, pacing, gameplay and story methods) to the absolutely genius level design that blends triggers, enviromental storytelling and gives space to the player to explore at their own pace feeling like an open world and not a mere sandbox game (at least in the karnaca area) like the first dishonored. And there is the enemies with their placement, routes and behaviur that creates a constant threat to the player but with the intention for the player to outsmart them with all their abilities, not just killing them. Every guard is a problem/situation to solve, not just an NPC.  Top notch graphics, great sound design and aesthetics.  But technical problems dont let this game shine as it should. Right now you need a monster pc to runt it without excessive framedrops (i5 6600k, gtx 1060 and with everything on medium i have constant drops) and for a reason the mouse movenent is broken so you cant aim properly, which lead us to the biggest problem, it is difficult to navigate around you and to be immersed from all the attention to detail that exist in this game. Simple put, you pass through everything because it doesnt feel right to do things in this game, in contrast, the first dishonored succeded 100% in this.  I dont want to be judjemental because it is clear that all the people who worked in this game put their souls and it shows, it is a game made from smart people with love for their craft.

Make the game Free 2 Play and keep the card packs as DLC to bring more players in since it is lacking a lot of content for people that spend 10$ on the game itself.

5317908,406550,Umineko When They Cry - Question Arcs,"EDIT: The patch that adds voice acting and PS3 graphics is finally out! Go get it  here  [github.com]    Don’t let my play time fool you, I’ve already read the entire thing through the old fan patch, apparently the translation on the steam release greatly improves on that already excellent translation, so I’m looking forward to rereading it all. In this review I will be covering mostly the technical aspects of Umineko, so I’ll avoid talking about the story – it is best to go in without knowing what you’re getting into.     Sound:    Originally this work was a sound novel and not a visual novel, so you can guess the sound has an extra layer of attention given to it, and it shows.  There are almost 200 songs in the entire soundtrack composed by 5+ different artists. The genres spam all the way from instrumental piano to psychedelic trance. The range is amazing and somehow it manages to deliver the most fitting song for each scene, regardless of the musical genre.  Notable songs on the question arc include  Dreamenddischarger  and  Hope .  It’s a shame the steam version did not include voice acting, presumably because of licensing issues, as it is one of the best in the entire visual novel medium. The patch I linked will restore the voices along with the PS3 sprites and backgrounds which in my opinion look way better than the steam version.     Characters:    The cast is absolutely huge, by the end of the eight episode there were over 50 characters in total, but never at any point did it feel like there were more than it could handle, all of the characters had their own goals and motivations driving them forward and almost all of them had a significant impact on the story. The characters are also well developed and become people you actually care about, each with their flaws and distinct personalities. This novel is exceptionally good on characterization, out of the 18 main characters there is not a single one that is bland, generic or reliant on character tropes and that in itself is an achievement.     Content:    This is the first four episodes of a series of eight episodes. It takes roughly 50 hours to read through the first four episodes (question arc), and another 50 hours to go through the final four (answer arc), one of the longest visual novels out there. It is very acclaimed by the western visual novel community as a whole, ranking up top 5 in rating on  vndb  [vndb.org] . There is no sexual content on Umineko and nothing on the steam version was cut out or censored, making it the definitive version of one of the greatest visual novels to date.     Final thoughts:    This novel is a finely crafted masterpiece and a truly unforgettable experience. I urge everyone to give it a try, especially if you are a fan of visual novels, this is one you absolutely can’t miss. There are reasons Umineko no Naku Koro ni is ranked #5 on vndb, and while I wrote a couple of them here, the rest is for you to enjoy.",1,1

Maybe that's a personal thing, but it feels more like a jab at modern society rather than the barbarian setting that it presents it self as, making it seem less like a parody and a poor attempt at social commentary shoehorned into an unrelated game grinding against its themeing.",-1,0

5332304,40800,Super Meat Boy,"This is a fun game at first. But don't expect to play all of the challenge levels and unlock all of the characters, because you won't. This game is too hard. I enjoy difficult, challenging games, but this game is absolutely too hard. If I feel like it's work more than it is fun, it's not worth playing.  Here's the basic way of thinking: If you like Mario or Sonic or Zelda or something along those lines, where there is a challenge and you get punished for doing wrong, then you'll love the beginning of this game. If you like good controls and solid gameplay and fun level design, it's great. Then it gets harder.  If you like to memorize patterns down to pixel-perfect timing and go through the motions over and over and over and over again for little reward, then keep playing. If you like to spend literally hours doing the exact same movements over and over and hoping that luck will give you the specific pattern you need to beat the level, then this game is for you. You CANNOT beat this game unless you devote hours to memorizing the specific gravity mechanics implemented and force yourself to go again and again until you know this game inside and out. I'm just not that committed to some dumb game a couple of guys made. I mean, it's a great concept and everything, but to me 'OMG SUIPER HARD YOU HAVE TO BE RIGHT ON THE RIGHT PIXEL AT THE RIGHT MILISECOND OR YOU GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING' does not equal quality.  In conclusion, if you are a speed player or one of those guys on youtube that can calculate a game glitch down to the frame that you are supposed to press a button, this game is for you. If you just like games to be fun and not hardcore work that you have to devote to something, I'd just demo the first couple of levels, if not skip it completely. I hate to have 67% complete in games (it just annoys me) but I have to on this game because I have a wife and a real, big-boy life that I have to live, and can't dedicate that much time and energy to some sh*tty platformer.",-1,0

5336905,40800,Super Meat Boy,"Really solid platformer. Easy to play, difficult to master. I've got around 25 hours on this so far, which is extremely impressive for such an affordable game - also I've got around 5200 deaths. Which just goes to show how hard it is, goes back to the good old days of twitch reflexes - the way platformers are meant to be.",1,0
5337588,408120,Cibele,"Firstly, I don't think £6 is a reasonable price for something that is essentially a short film with perfunctory interactive segments, especially when the expected playtime was 1.5 to 2 hours and it took me just over an hour to play the game. That said, I received Cibele as part of the narrative Humble Bundle, so I feel like it was worth it whatever segment of the price went to it in that context.  I did, however, enjoy the story, even if I found the acting a little lacking at times. I especially enjoyed the look and feel of the MMORPG! I'm not sure whether it was my computer or intentionally designed that way, but certain parts of the boss fights were laggy, and that definitely upped the realism of it. :'D  I'm aware that the story is purely about Nina and her first love with a guy she meets online, but I would have loved a little more focus on the periphary characters and the relationships Nina had with them and how her relationship with Blake had affected that. You get an idea of what's happening, but I would have just liked more, you know? Plus I feel like the game could have used a follow-up act, but that might just be me.  Overall, I don't have negative feelings about Cibele--I enjoyed my time experiencing it--but I'm not sure I can recommend it at the Steam retail price based on what the product is itself; I don't think there's £6 worth of pay-off here.",-1,0

5338182,408650,ChromaGun,"This game is alright as a premise, but I think it needed a lot more work before asking for $10+. The controls are pretty clunky, the rooms are all bland and white, and overall it feels like the Alpha/Protoptype of a game that should've had more development put into it. It also tried way too hard to copy Portal's formula; You are given a puzzle-gun to solve puzzles in white rooms while a narrator watches and comments on your actions, all while the facility goes to ♥♥♥♥ as you are testing in it. The puzzles themselves are fairly simple, which may be a consequence of the simplistic premise that floating robots are attracted to color panels that match their own color.  Normally I really love puzzle games, but I just can't recommend this one as is. It feels like an awkward, free mod to a better puzzle game. I just found it far too tedious and I rarely found any satisfaction in solving a puzzle.",-1,0
5338646,408740,Pro Gamer Manager,"After the 10 hours I put in this game I can't really tell you anything at all about the heroes you pick, what makes most stats go up, which heroes are good counters to others, how the specialties affect your playstyle, how any of the stats affect your playstyle, or how to get wins outside of hoping for the best.  It has its moments of being a lot of fun, and theres a ton of potential so I hope the devs keep working on it and updating it (which seems to be the case) but for the moment the game gives you almost no information as to what you should be doing / could be doing to get better, or any inisght into any different playstyles. The complete lack of tooltips, a help section, or even a tutorial makes this game very frustrating because you're left to guess about so much. I hope I get to change this to a thumbs up in the future, its just missing too much at the moment still.  **EDIT** Do not not buy this game under any circumstances. The game that was released was not even a little finished and after promising for months that new updates were going to be implemented players were given news that it was finally happening this week. But they had the nerve to say that these new updates were going to be a DLC and that while people who own the game already will be able to download it for free that they intend to charge for it in the future.  I repeat, these developers think its okay to charge you for a game that isn't even a little finished and then charge you again for an update that fixes part of the game... Do not support this crap",-1,0

5342619,409160,"Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and The Terribly Cursed Emerald: A Whirlwind Heist","This is a simple game. In terms of interaction, there's nothing more than button pressing and following instructions, your character even lacks a jump! With such simple games it's often difficult to convey what makes them compelling without saying, 'just play it.'  With this though, there's really nothing more that needs to be said. It's thirty minutes long (if you take your time) with the impeccable timing that's come to characterise the games from this developer. The audio cues are excellent, the narrator fits extremely well (even if you don't like Amstell, he wokrs well here) and the premise is simple, but well executed.

It's like one of those presents from a cheapskate parents who say it's like minecraft, but free! The only thing that works is the unistall button. Also heres a guide on how to do that go to libary, find Genesis Online, right click on it and then click on delete local content and then click ok.

5349158,409710,BioShock Remastered,"  Very bad port. Nothing is changed visualy from the original. Just that it supports widescreen resolutions. The controls are the worst. Any change made in the controls settings and applied, turn on prompts for the xbox controller. Also, menus don't work with the mouse after this happens, until I restart. When this happens, my controller isn't even connected (it's not even installed on this PC).  This is a horrible excuse of an homage given to the amazing classic Bioshock!  EDIT: Forgot to mention that (as a personal preference) I use two buttons on my 7 button mouse, as volume up and volume down, for easy volume control while in games. This is the first game that I've had issues with this setting. When I click the volume down button, the game opens the main menu and when I click volume up it opens the map menu. There is no way I can rebind this(or unbind, more exaclty)",-1,0

5355902,410320,EARTH DEFENSE FORCE 4.1  The Shadow of New Despair,"Do you like EDF? If so, get this already. It's good. Puts the PS3/PS4 versions to shame with beautiful 60 FPS even on a subpar rig like mine (With a mere 680 GTX).  For those who aren't familiar with EDF, it's the videogame equivalent of an Alien Invasion B-Movie. Earth is under siege by aliens and their giant bug minions, and it's up to you (and up to three allies if playing co-op) to blow up everything in sight to save the Earth. Thankfully, there's no civilian casualties to worry about (They can't die for some reason) and all the buiildings are evacuated, so if a skyscraper or two gets blown up...No harm, no foul.  The flow of the game is very simple. Begin a mission. Kill everything. Grab loot. Move on. There's no complex objectives. Just kill and don't be killed while grabbing items that will strengthen you on future missions such as max health ups and new guns to improve your arsenal. Most guns can reload infinitely aside from a few special ones that you'll likely never use, so you aren't going to be looking for more bullets. More health packs, yes, but bullets, no. Just keep shooting.  The game's a budget one, but its sense of scale is amazing, as you'll fight through entire city blocks, levelling them as you blow up every bug in sight. You'll start with simple rifles, but get launchers that can easily destroy entire hordes, mechs that can wipe out entire streets, and a Pacific Rim style robot that can punch its way through equally large baddies.",1,0
5356090,410320,EARTH DEFENSE FORCE 4.1  The Shadow of New Despair,Ｅｘcellent！ EDF's co-op is ridiculously fun but  There are still a lot of bugs. Don't buy it if your GPU is GeForce GTX 10-Series. Extremely laggy and almost unplayable.,-1,1
5357154,410380,,"If you have played Magic:The Gathering - This game offers a much better ui than MTGO, as well as much less money investment to gain ratio. The cards are cheaper than magic, the format is healthier (in my opinion) It is up to the team to mess it up at this point. Imagine magic but it started printing now, with 15+years of experience on how to make the game fun an interesting. Add in exclusive mechanics and cards that only can work digitally, no shuffling, and the abilities of the champions (much like hearthstone) That is HEX  If you have played hearthstone you will find this harder - but more fun in my opinion. It being a TCG means you arent just wasting money for cards...you can sell and rebuy and trade with others which is far more fun to me.  If you have never played a card game, going through the PVE section of this acts as a tutorial and will get you up with basics. The more complex ideas of mana curve, percentages, efficiencies can be learned over time or by reading strategy guides (or watching others on twitch)  Hit me up -Aristaeus, watch Jeffhoogland on youtube (follow him on twitter/fb, he is good at responding to questions)  Def reccomend!",1,0
5357417,410380,,"This game got me in the beginning, but after a short campaing the difficulty level gets stressful.

5357442,410380,,"  Ok, after two days of playing this game i have come to think, its not worth even getting this game and playing it. I say this because after getting into the 'higher' pve decks it gets very very hard to beat, this i assume is a way for the ppls at HEX to get you to buy cards. its not haveing that affect on me, instead you see me here writing this review and uninstalling this game. Thats not the only reason i dont recomend this game, the effects of said cards are way over the top, not much Balancing whent in to the creation of these cards. So many very overpowered cards, i am talking common cards, being sooo powerfull. also in the PVE u have to fight though dungons to get further into the quest line, THE FIRST non tutorial dungion is 5 sub boss fighters and then if you make it thought that you get an overpowered boss fight, did i mention you only have 2 trys before the dungion kicks you and you have to do it all over again.Also another problem, the pve opponets will alwys get there optimum hand to fight you, there is no chance in fighting computor opponets, seems card limits are out the window as well for the cpu, just another trick to get you to buy there boster packs and decks. sorry i dont like getiing haevy handed into buying thing..so this is not for me, if you feel its for you, go for it.

5358100,410590,,"After missing some final purchases in the Winter Sale becaue I thought I had all day, I decided on a different sort of mission. What was the cheapest, most horrible, game I could find on Steam just to get a laugh? While there are probably worse games, this one at $.049 is a pretty good contender. Ultimately, since most people are not trying to find the worst games they can, I will non-rec this game. If you want a terrible laugh then go ahead and get it.  Gameplay:  Well, it's your run of the mill, early 90's, overhead, sneak around avoiding traps with completely miscalibrated mouse movement in a stupidly difficult level type of game. We all know them, right? Sadly, the awesome voice acting stopped and at least as far as I've made it so far (Level 7) it hasn't been back. I can only hope any further efforts will reward me with another clip of that script. Luckily, on each level there seems to be at least one or two places you can squeeze behind the poorly-placed obstacles and completely avoid the level all together. In fact, that is about the only way I think it's probably even possible to score the times they require to get the gold trophies. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention there's a trophy system. Each level has pre-determined times to get Gold, Silver, Bronze, or...Wood. I've got lots of wood!  As expected, the game is not very good. But.....I did play it longer than I expected and it kept me wanting to come back for more just so I could say I beat the next level. Kind of a masochistic one more turn syndrome. If the mouse actually controlled acurrately, it wouldn't be so terrible. At full price it's a dollar, so you get what you pay for. Having paid even less than that I can honestly say, despite it's numerous, glaring, faults, it occupied me enough to be worth the spare change I find under my car seat. Throw in the humor derived from it's utter failure at being a serious game and it might even be worth $0.60.   Did I mention the script is a barely veiled attempt at suggesting you are sneaking into Gitmo to free the captives? Not sure why all the walls in the place are biohazard or radiation symbols. I suppose that is the developers way to remind us all that the prison is controlled by the evil nuclear superpower.   If you are pondering whether to check this game out, you must ask yourself one thing. Are you ready to go to hell and back with Randy Crow?",-1,1

5363070,410850,DRAGON QUEST HEROES™ Slime Edition,For years now i have been a huge fan of DQ. This game has not let me down. I am enjoying this game so far and finding it changelling in places and funny at others. There is one part i am not keen on and that is after every mission you get sent back to the Stonecloud and personally i would prefer to chose that option as i would prefer to keep going until i feel ready to return myself and not after every mission. But all in all i am enjoying this game and will continue to enjoy it even if the voices are different and weird accents that are quite amusing. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys story combat and and RPG experience. Also i love the loot theres lots of loot but sadly there is a lack of inventory space and can only carry 30 items any number of same item but only 30. Also a walkthrough guide maybe needed if you need help as this game can get a bit confusing. All in all i am loving the game and hope they make more.,1,0
5363086,410850,DRAGON QUEST HEROES™ Slime Edition,"So this is a little gem in the dark dank mines that is known as Koei Tecmo. Like many of the fans of these kinds of hack and slash games like (Dynasty Warriors) and others that have become from KT with inferior ports to the PC compared to their console counterparts, I shared a concern.  However allow me to allievate most of your concerns if I can:     Like most of these kinds of games, you'll most likely want to try a controller, I can safely say that it runs super smooth and all the prompts for this port work correctly!    Stable 60FPS, not a single drop.    PS4 Texture Ports (So it doesn't like like a terrible PS3 port), unfortunately max resolution is 1920 x 1080 but for most including my self this isn't really a problem, sure in 2015 its kind of gross for any Developor to not properly add in all the resolutions but I honestly can't care enough at this time, I didn't have high enough hopes as it is from KT.    This is way more in depth then Hyrule Warriors and Dynasty Warriors for those wondering, it has a decent selection of items(but so did those two other games) several spells, RPG elements, monster summoning (you can capture them in this game and basically use them like towers). All in all its an Action game with a decent light RPG system.   I was expecting trash but I can honestly say I'm really happy with Dragon Quest Heroes, this is the first Koei Techmo game that wasn't trash and while this is my very first Dragon Quest, I'm happy to say I like the style of the art and the such.   I know some others are complaining that its not a full fledged tactical RPG for which the Dragon Quest name is famous for but for those of you who like this genre of game like DW and HW, then you are in for a special treat.

5366348,411830,SENRAN KAGURA SHINOVI VERSUS,"Disclaimer: As of writing this I have only completed the Gessen Storyline and the Hebijo one (see the first edit at the bottom on what I think of it), yet to do the others.  While on the surface it looks like Anime ♥♥♥♥ The Game, great storywriting and characters as well as great hack and slash gameplay makes Senran Kagura more than just fanservice.  I was surprised when I played through the Gessen campaign. Pleasantly surprised. Having no expectations whatsoever for the game (indeed, I only got this because I wanted a hack and slash and I forgot Dynasty Warriors was on Steam), I was prepared for just some mindless killing and a bit of ♥♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥. I am very picky when it comes to narrative in videogames. It has to grab me from the start, and Senran Kagura did just that. The campaign I played had a dumb as hell plot at first, with the stupidest of reasons for the members of the school to fight each other. However it eventually turns into a touching plot about mentorship, friendship, and the idea of good and evil. The 5 girls in this particular campaign at first look like one dimensional tropes, but you eventually learn of their tragic backstories which may or may not have used what I like to call the Batman Trope (You know what that is, and if you don't, I'm referring to the event that made Bruce Batman to begin with) that led to their current path as shinobis. The beauty of this is that they are characters you feel an attachment to, and enjoy watching grow, you also get to fondle their breasts and put them in the most revealing of outfits. So there's that.  Enough about the story, how is the gameplay? My answer, very good. I can barely manage with Keyboard and mouse although this game is clearly meant to be used by controllers. But I do not have one at present, so I can't really say. Do keep in mind that the keyboard controls are actually alright by itself though (Q is LB and R is RB for menu controls. You're welcome.) The combat is well executed in my opinion with great visual effects, as well as a constant 60 fps despite how busy the screen is. The fanservice here is characters who take too much damage get their clothes ripped. And I have managed once or twice to even get the undies off my opponent if I hit her hard enough, so if you want that kind of fanservice this game has you covered. Edit: The camera is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mess. For all that's holy LOCK ON TO A TARGET ASAP.  Costumes are well designed and are what I can describe as Anita Sarkeesian's worst nightmare. You get all the dlc from the Vita version in this port for free as well.  The lingerie lottery though is a bit of an interesting system. 98 lingerie sets are waiting to be unlocked. To unlock one pay any amount of cash you want; but the more you pay the less chance there is of a repeat. Being a fan of blind bags and TCG booster packs and the thrill of packing something you don't have I love this feature. Though most of the stuff is HIDEOUS imo and of the ones I have I'll only use one or two of those. (also on a side note I have regressed so much that I snark at lingerie designs. What has my life come to.)  The Dressing Room is where you customise your shinobi to look as: a) Hot and sexy as possible b) Cute as possible c) Cool as possible d) Downright hideous And the options can be overwhelming. Once you buy the stuff that is. Schoolgirl outfits, Christmas, nuns, aprons, any kind of fetish you have, there is probably a costume for it (Slight exaggeration, there are only a few fetishes here). Though the fullscreen mode is a tad underwhelming. I like to call this the molestation mode, but all you can do is swipe their clothes off and fondle their breasts. That's it. They do have reactions to your actions, but they all use the same animations anyway. Not like I wanted this part or anything, but it does feel phoned in to me.  In conclusion, is Senran Kagura worth buying? I answer with a hearty YES. At least one of the campaigns is great and at the very least has me interested into playing the rest, and unlocking the rest of the characters. If you don't like fanservice at all this probably isn't for you, because there is A LOT of it. The gameplay is solid, performance is great and the customisation is pretty good as well. I will play the rest of it then update this review.  EDIT 1: I've played the Hebijo campaign. And while it was a bit weaker than the Gessen story, it was still an emotional rollercoaster, dealing with the topics of restoring honour, loyalty, redemption and revenge. The characters' backstories are also well written like the first, but the reason why I say it was weaker than the Gessen story is more of a personal thing, I just successfully predicted the ending of it and how it would pan out, making it less interesting and making me think it as very cliched. Overall though I recommend this part and this game even more, especially if it means that the other 2 campaigns are at least as good as this one. Also Miyabi's side quest is hilarious and I recommend you play it at least ones. Now I'm off to do the Hanzo campaign. I'll be back.",1,0
5366448,411830,SENRAN KAGURA SHINOVI VERSUS,"Every time someone buys this game, a Feminist loses her Safe Space.  But seriously, it is a good game. I didn't expect to enjoy the combat as much as I did. It actually plays, looks, and sounds great.  TL:DR COMPLETE --- Full Review Below ---   Graphics: Didn't get a clock on the FPS, but the game runs pretty well. Didn't see much issue.  The animation is fluid and crisp, and there is an array of character designs with many options for customization at your finger tips.  Over all 8/10, could be higher with a little more detail but glad they didn't, game runs great.  Sound: The Music is nice, and each area has its own theme. You can adjust the sliders for Music, SFX, and Voice to your taste if any one gets on your nerves over time. But for me, I am a purist, I usually want the in game music and sound fx experience. But there are sliders for those that care. The sound fx seems legit, and nothing coms to mind as standing out, which is usually a good sign. The voice overs are well done. For the life of me I wish I knew WTF they were saying. Sure there is Text on the screen, but you don't have time to read it while you are doing the boss fights usually. However, it is top notch stuff, just like any of the Anime's that you can think of that were not English dubbed. Although I do like the real voice actors, I am one of those types that do also enjoy some localization, and so I am going to go with: 7/10 for Sound, its great, no problems, but would of liked some English, but it doesn't hurt the game.  Gameplay: This is where I was most surprised. The combat system is RPG like, so you progress with new abilities as you get better. And you do get XP when you lose too, just not very much. But this can help you not lose hope on a tough boss when you are just trying to figure out the game. This game is heavy on trying to keep the combo meter on the rise, so you really have to have spatial awareness and this can be hard in a game with camera controls like this. However, this is a lockon system that will help you out if you find yourself having trouble. Each character has their own fighting style that varies in look and feel. And there is the Shinobi Transformation system that is reallypretty much the icing on the cake for this game. It's all fan service, but it actually has a reason to exist in the game. You see, somehow your clothes make you stronger, so as you fight, you might have them get shreaded a bit and you get weaker. So this is where the Shinobi Transformation comes into play, as you get a fresh new outfit that also makes you stronger than your default self. And on top of that, after you transform you can do Secret Ninja Art attacks that can turn the tide of battle pretty fast. And each character gets 2 different types of these. And there is a block system, and a counter system, which if timed right helps recharge your transformations. There is tons of ariel / warp to enemy finish attacks to enjoy. And if all else fails, you can do this one move to rip your own clothes to rampage a bit and gain attack while losing defense, so that is something else you can do if you like. As far the RPG elements, it seems there are 3 branches and you get gains in them by doing skills that are in that branch. So it follows on of my fav. RPG gain systems, which is use a skill and you gain skill in that skill, it just makes more sense than level up and spend points at will to me. So: I give it a 8/10 on gameplay, as it seems to have some replay value, and there is PvP Online if you want to do that.  Going to wrap it up now, don't have much more to say, so final conclusion is:  8/10 - Good Game. Get if/when you can. You don't have to wait for a sale, its good. But if its too high, which it is a bit, wait. But I heard since it comes with all the DLC, on the other system it was like $120 bucks with everything, so in a way this is a deal. Enjoy!",1,1

5376787,413410,Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc,"I can't give this game a thumb up despite how much I loved it as a kid.  I used to think that the plot was amazing, but now I feel that it is just...cringy.  It's unrealistic. Way too unrealistic that it's become absurd.  The storyline is that the protagonist, along with his classmates, is trapped in a school specially for privileged elites. They are told, by a teddy bear who claims to be their school prinicipal, that they will have to live in the school for the foreseeable future.  Unless they manage to kill someone without anyone else finding out.   'So what happens if the killer is found out?' you may ask. The answer is that he'll be executed by the prinicipal. With every other student watching. The first murderer    is hit to death by baseballs.    The second murderer    is made into butter, spread onto toast and eaten by the prinipal.    All unnecessarily violent.  One of the most preposterous parts of this game is that nobody seems THAT upset even when someone is brutally killed right in front his very own eyes. Even the   weaker ones   would at most cry a bit and say that they would never want to see this happening again.  Still, the annoying protagonist keeps repeating that they are all very desperate. They don't look very bothered to me though. It is also infuriating to hear the protagonist justify his friends' actions by iterating that everything is the teddy bear's fault, attempting to convince the players that actually everyone else is innocent. I don't understand why so many Japanese anime like to make this kind of stuff - other than the only one b*stard who's truly evil, every character is innocent; if the supposedly innocent ones have done something wrong, that must've been because the b*stard had made them do it. :/   All in all, I wouldn't recommend you to get this game. It claims to be a mystery-solving kind of game, but the logic of their arguments is usually flawed. It might appeal to people who like reading about or watching movies about people killing other people in order to survive, and who like seeing people die in strange, unusual ways. :/",-1,1
5377443,413420,Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair,"TL;DR - If this game is on sale and you've played and enjoyed the first Danganronpa (Trigger Happy Havoc), this game is 100% worth the money. An instant buy if on sale, and still completely worth it at full price.  Long version below.  -----&lt;&lt; Non-Spoiler Review &gt;&gt;-----  For those interested in buying, I'm going to try to keep this as SPOILER FREE as possible.   First of all, this game can be played without any prior Danganronpa knowledge but it is HIGHLY recommended you play the first Danganronpa entry before purchasing/playing DR2.    --&lt;&lt; WHAT IS IT &gt;&gt;--  The gameplay and premise in Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair is the similar it it's predecessor, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc. If this is the first Danganronpa entry that you're going to play, then Danganronpa plays like a regular visual novel, but with mini-games and collectibles. If you don't know what a visual novel is well it's technically like a book.   What makes Dangonronpa 2: Goodbye Despair different than any other visual novel? Well it's not about finding your favourite waifu and giving them presents (okay there is some of it, but it's not the main point!) but rather it is a darker toned, muder-mystery type visual novel. Sort of like a weird, zany, mix of Phoenix Wright and Zero Escape.  --&lt;&lt; PREMISE &gt;&gt;--  As I said above the premise is similar to the first game. You play as a rather normal looking male highschooler hoping to attend one of the worlds most prestigious school, the inspiring and incredible Hope's Peak Academy. But before you long, you realize you've actually been thrown into some sick, battle royale-esque, life or death game with other extremely talented and goofy students.  The only way to escape this terrifying game is to MURDER another student and get away with it. After a certain amount of time after a bodies discovery, a class trial will be held. At this point you and the other students must discover the 'Blackened' (in other words the killer) and vote him/her as the culprit. If you're wrong, well then.. everyone get's executed and the Blackened will escape the game!   P.S - There is a lot of death in this game.   --&lt;&lt; GAMEPLAY &gt;&gt;--  Now that you get a gist of the premise and what type of game it is, now let's go over the general gameplay.   For the most part, the game is a regular visual novel. There are lots of text and lots to read. The game is usually broken into segments of:  Free Time Investigations Class Trials  Free Time is when you're allowed to do, well, whatever you want. You can travel around and speak with the other students and learn more about them and you know, give your waifus presents and good stuff like that.   Investigations are moments in the story where you are given an amount of time to go around investigate and gather clues before the Class Trials begin.  Last but not least, the Class Trials are where your wits will be put to the test. A lot of the minigames require you to logically point out/agree with mistakes in your classmates testimonies, and this part of the game is rather intense. There are a lot of mini-games and they're rather difficult to explain so I'm not going to, but they vary from intense jeopardy type games to slicing words across the screen with a blade and then countering to rythmn mini-games.   There are also up to 3 different difficulty settings if you just want to casually enjoy the game or want to challenge yourself (and the game is challenging).  There is a sort of world map like hub where you get to walk around and travel to where you want to go. After entering you can move a first-person camera around to click and investigate on certain objects. There are also some first person dungeon-like maps where you can physically walk around and look at stuff but these are a bit more rare.   If we compare the game to Danganronpa 1, it improves on this point in almost every aspect (I'm looking at you Hangman's Gambit mini-game.. -shudders-).   --&lt;&lt; MUSIC &gt;&gt;--  It's good. Certain themes are quite memorable.   DUAL AUDIO ! (Yayy! JP VOICES!)  --&lt;&lt; CHARACTERS &gt;&gt;--   If not for the f**king insane story and cases you're going to have to solve, pick it up for the incredible and lovable cast of characters.   Danganronpa is a type of game where, well, you're never going to be sure who's going to survive to the end. But because of the Dating Sim-like Free Time segments, there are some characters that you're going to really grow attached to. Which is a good thing in most games. But in this game, where you're never sure who's going to get the axe next.. It's a pretty scary feeling.   It's also what makes Danganronpa games so fun in general. There's something about picking out your favourite characters at the very beginning, getting to know them, and praying to god that they make it through this ordeal with you.   It's nothing like watching the cast of characters dwindle down, only to see a handful remain, growing to trust them, only to tragically realize another body has been found.   It's rather heartbreaking.   I also enjoyed these characters more than the ones in the first game, but that's probably preference. By the end of the first game I was probably only attached to 2 of the suvivors, but by the end of DR2 I was heartbroken, and attached to everyone that made it through.  --&lt;&lt; STORY &gt;&gt;--   Don't want to go into detail here. There are a huge amount of references to the first game which make this game much better to play. But you can definitely jump into DR2 without playing the first one.   But to sum it up, the story is amazing.    --&lt;&lt; CONCLUSION &gt;&gt;--  If you're a fan of Phoenix Wright, Zero Escape, or Visual Novels and are looking for something new, buy DR1 THEN buy this game. It's challenging, decently long from 20-30 hours depending on how you pace yourself, with an INCREDIBLE story that only builds upon everything that was great from DR1 and makes it even better in DR2.  It's completely worth the cash. Every cent of it. Easilly one of the best games I've played in the last few years and I cannot wait for Danganronpa V3 to come out on the PS4/VITA.",1,0
5378441,413680,Statues,"Statues is a first person horror game in the likes of Slenderman, daylight and doorways but with lesser quality and no plot. The concept of the game is quite interesting in the sense that the monster chases you when you turn your back to him but when you face him he becomes immobile like a statue. Now you cannot face him constantly because each 10 seconds your eyes blink for a few seconds and this is when he can snatch you. That being said the main objective remains to avoid being caught by the monster and escape the premise.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDmF__e5p-Y&amp;feature=youtu.be   Considering the price point of around 9-10$, I would not recommend this game. I would recommend buying it at around 5$ which seems like a fair price to me. However, if you are a fan of the genre and have money to waste be my guest.  Positive: - Interesting gameplay. - Sound FX. - A few scary moments. - Saving check points.  Negative: - Death is frequent and annoying in the first level. - The 'e' use key feels unresponsive at times. - Blinking every 10 seconds becomes annoying in the long run. - Annoying low stamina. - Subpar graphics, no guns, no plot and no killing monsters. - Price",-1,1
5378530,413710,Blood and Gold: Caribbean!,"OK after playing quite a lot of M&amp;B, I decided I needed to write again this review and replace the more  funny approach  [pastebin.com]  with a more serious one.  As other users have mentioned, be it they thumb this game up or down, the game is quite glitchy. I personally felt that the M&amp;B engine worked wonderfully with this game, but sadly I can't really comment how much of an improvement it was compared to the first release, since I never played that.   It all comes down to how much a person gets affected by minor glitches and bugs, along with lag. Whatever the changes under the hood are in B&amp;G, the game is quite a bit more laggy and it has some battlefields that it lags for no particular reason. You actually can experience the same kind of lag even in mods of M&amp;B so I am feeling there is something in the actual native engine that causes the problems.  These though battles can be mostly ignored, since at least I did not do that many battles on land and in sea I did not experience bad lag. Where though the lag is real, is sieges. I only done one land siege and the rest were all sea sieges, so I can't really comment on the land ones. Sea sieges though will make you lag like crazy. The main reason is that the battle is actually all of your troops against all the troops of the enemy at once. There are no controlled waves that depending you computer you can make larger or smaller. I am on a C2Quad @3.2GHz and a ATI R9 280X 3GB and the battle would reach as low as 6-8 FPS while the ships are heading towards the fortress, before any battle starts. Obviously as the battle starts and enemies and allies die, the FPS slowly gets better, but no matter what the lag is bad. Keep in mind I am not saying that the only reason the lag is so bad is the huge battles, but also even normal battles do not feel as smooth as M&amp;Bs.  Obviously there are quite some other glitches and problems, some that can break immersion for some people. For me the main things that are missing are more ship models, which I can understand why they are hard to be implemented.  The game is quite unrefined, but for loved of Pirate games that could enjoy a mediocre game running on the M&amp;B engine, I am sure you will love it as much as me. I enjoyed it and easily would replay.  Now something a bit off topic, is that when I read reviews on here, I feel people are comparing B&amp;G with all the awesome free community modules that people can get in M&amp;B. The reason is that they make M&amp;B Warband sound so highly sophisticated and perfect, but maybe because I have played so many of its community mods, I find M&amp;B:W a really nice game, but not all that perfect. Obviously if you compare its huge gamma of modules you can get on it with just a game that feels like a module itself, it will not hold a candle to it.   At least as far as I know, there are no other modules with Naval battles like B&amp;G. Viking Conquest/Brytenwalda naval battles do not feel anything like B&amp;G's and at least I do not know any mods that does anything close to it. Definitely a diamond in the rough that I am hoping it will be polished. Honestly though, I bought it on a sale and the 130 or so hours I put into it have already earned more than I payed.",1,0

There aren't any instructions, so by the time you get to the third or fourth level you have no idea what all these symbols and markings mean. The only way to find out is to ram into them and then most likely die. Bottom line, don't buy it.",-1,0

5409896,418180,Tempest,"  Been keeping an eye on this one and recieved it as a gift. I really did give it a try, but I cannot recommend this to anyone. It feels unfinished, even though it is no longer in Early Access. The combat is clunky and severely unbalanced, no matter the difficulty level. NPC ships have 'artifacts' they can use at will, with ships that have levels of damage (attack/defenes) far in excess of anything the player can get.  I would ask for a refund, but I recieved this as a gift, and tried the game out for 2 hours.",-1,0
5410019,418180,Tempest,"As of right now I played for 3.7 frustrating hours and though I want to continue playing this game I honestly can't give it a thumbs up. The game itself is promising and has a very good chance to become one of the most enjoyable pirate games. But in the current state (1.03) the downsites are too prevelant to recommend this game to others. If you are interested in this game look for gameplay material on youtube and some reviews of game magazines. Look at the many cool stuff this game has to offer but also be aware of the annoyances (and especially if they are fixed/patched by the time you buy). As so much already highlighted to positive side of this game I will only list the game breakers for me.  CONS: - boring, uninspiring and grindy trade mechanic (no price changes, find a good route and grind for money) - boarding lacks any kind of inspiration. You can't do anything besides clicking a few icons a few times and watch your crew fight. - lack of ingame explanation. As this is somewhat of a general topic I will focus on the boarding mechanic again. Other than a few lines in the tutorial missions the boarding mechanic will never be explained in any depth. You can shoot a enemy ship down to nearly zero crew and board with your fully manned ship and nevertheless loose the battle. There might be a logical sense behind the outcome of this fight but the game will give you no indications at all why you failed.  As I already mentioned there are for sure many positive sides to this game and I really hope the devs will pick up on the baddies and fix them. In conclusion, I would rate this game to be decent (not good, not bad) in the current state. If you like pirate games and feel like experimenting give it a try, the base price of 15€ isn't that much of a deal.  ",-1,0

First of all the reason this game is getting so much praise is because of all these damn weebs and another thing I noticed in a positive review for this game.   A user stated that 'Splendid visual novel, great music and storyline!'. Reading this sentence I wanted to blow my damn brains out becuase well first of all the music is so so so bad. There is about a minute until the music ends then there is about a 1 second pause and music starts up again. However I was suprised that there was yet another song added at the end so props for that.   Another thing is that there is absolutely no substance to this game. I've counted about 5 differant facial expression changes on the 'AI' character and it's a complete wase of time to play. I ended up finishing it in about 4-6 minutes. But the story is just the main character Jung (which you never get to see sadly) and AI talking about nothing, absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ nothing. All for what? A ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ending that made every Weeaboo that played this game cry. Just a complete waste of time.  And this visual novel isn't very visual. What I mean by this is that there are about 8 or so mediocre scenes that you get to stare at whilst you look at AI. Sounds fun right? Another thing is that there is no immersion. Honestly I love gameplay I love the feeling like i'm in the setting but this game doesn't even attempt to bring that to the table. It's your character and AI just talking about nothing in peticular with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ looping soundtrack and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ backgrounds.    CONCLUSION",-1,1

5450804,42670,Singularity,"Singularity is a quality, fairly short blast of silliness. It aspires to be comparable to 'Bioshock', a worthy aim that it comes admirably close to fulfilling.   Although Gamespot said that the game's visuals were a little lacking (their overall review was positive, giving it 8/10, and a 'Great') I thought the environments were pretty awesome. Highlights for me were when you saw a location in the present, only to be flung back in time 50 years, to see the same place in all its shiny freshness. I was surprised that they didn't actually do this more often in the game really. Another iteration of this visual effect was walking though a ship where sudden time-pulses would age it, as you stumbled onward. A wall of rust and corrosion would move like a wave over every surface, an original and interesting idea.   Furthermore, the gunplay of the game was slick and satisfying, suffering from none of the 'sludginess' that some FPS's can have. Comparisons to that of 'Bioshock' are again tempting - the enemy body physics, the art design of the guns, the damage effects of your weapons: all were oddly similar.   But there were more obvious similarities. For example, the character enhancement and gun customization elements seemed like brazen copies (perhaps I should say 'respectful homages'?) to the 'Bioshock' franchise. The 'secondary weapon' in your other hand (here, the so-called Time Manipulation Device, Singularity's answer to Plasmids) was identical! While these elements worked well, they were all ultimately a little limited because the game is so much shorter.   As regards developing a credible 'alternative world' and engaging in deeper philosophical questions, Singularity only dabbled the fingers of its TMD-adorned-hand ever so slightly in these areas. Ultimately the game puts playability and humour first - think Red Alert crossed between Metro 2033, and you're warm - and there is never any shame in that.   It's a short game - even if you're a thorough completionist, like me, it will still all be over in about 10 hours - but the price reflects this. The game offers a fun, silly and satisfying ride.   There's no doubt that a Time Manipulation Device would be useful in reclaiming all those wasted hours frittered away on medicore games, but here at least it's time well spent!",1,0
5451409,42670,Singularity,"A gem I happen to find looking into the storyline. This is all the proper elements of shooters that exist from the past: Half Life, Bioshiock, Metro and the grim tones of Dead Space I. Underrated project Raven Software did a great job. I'd like to see a prequel in the future.",1,0
5451627,42670,Singularity,"Not really a bad game, it's just kind of an ugly, boring shooter that doesn't know what it wants to be. It starts out reminiscent of Bioshock, where you are in a facility where something has gone wrong and you only have notes and film projectors and such to seemingly place together the story. However, you then are introduced to the time travel mechanic and the game becomes a lot more plot heavy and 'shootbang'. There's about a 2 hour interlude of sorts where everything slows down and there's a drastic darker tonal shift which makes the game resemble something more like Metro 2033. I suppose it's interesting to have a game that blends different styles together but instead of being its own thing, Singularity ends up just seeming rather incoherent. There's also plenty of sections where you are simply running down corridors and shooting up nameless goons, where it really doesn't resemble anything other than maybe Call of Duty, only without any real spectacle.  The weapons are interesting, but I ended up using the assault rifle 90% of the time. Sure, I suppose you can say it's up to the play to spice up their loadout, but none of the enemies really suggested that anything else would have been a better option. The vigor/plasmid type powers are actually pretty cool and, unlike Bioshock Infinite, I found it pretty cool to not only rely on gunplay, but to also use the TMD abilities in the firefights as well.   There's really only 2, maybe 2.5 'boss fights' in the game, which are interesting enough. The game doesn't look the greatest and there are a lot of bad bad textures.  So if you've already played all of the Bioshock games and the Metro games and you want something vaguely similar and have a few days to spend on it, sure, grab this. Otherwise I can't really recommend it over any of those.",-1,0

How ever, some of the charectors stats need to be changed as some of them can do so much damage to you in one hit. and I am not sure if it because I am on the lowest setting but there is no water in shark island map where all the boats are etc.  I wish it wasn't a Pay to win game how ever it is a beta and always looking for improvements  Can't wait to play the next orcs must die.   Also I think we should be able to do an endless mode at different levels for example you have to use the keys to do it but you can do an endless game without the keys and it gives you less rewards. also you can have easy medium and hard / insane endless game modes to without a high level cap.  The only bad thing is, the crafting and upgrading system. Unless you want to pay for gold etc. then you would have to grind hours and hours to upgrade one thing. I love playing this game to bits as we some of the 'premium' character at our use. I have around 18 hours on record and havn't stopped playing it but I am not going to be spending REAL money just to buy gold as in my opinion it is to much anyway as you get so little.   If you want an online experiance in playing the classic orcs must die then get this game as it allows you to play online, how ever some of the old classic traps have been removed. Have fun and happy hunting.",1,0
5465352,427270,Orcs Must Die! Unchained,I like the game. Its fun But I can't play with friends from different regions. There is no way to change region to add any of my friends.  I don't understand why they don't just use steam network in the first place. Very disapointed.,-1,1
5465667,427270,Orcs Must Die! Unchained,"This is not a Tower-Defense, this is a just a bad, one-button third-person-shooter. No mazes, no puzzles. Traps do less than 25% of the killing work. Instead of mazing and creating a good killing box you have to build three or more boxes separately and kill most of the Orcs holding down you left mouse-button. Progression is extremely slow including endless grinds and replaying the same over and over again.  Though PvP gameply is definitely very well made, it lost the feeling of a TD (which made OMD2 good) completely.  Despite being in beta, overall I'm disappointed. They really need to rethink balancing and redo the maps, to make it a good game in the end.",-1,0

There are so many things to do:  -Set yourself on fire -Drink bleach (for the memes) -Drink soap -Drown yourself -Eat glass -Freeze yourself -and so much more!  This game is constantly making BIG updates and there is always a surprise when you see it downloading something new! Whether it's new ways to end your miserable baby life, more places to hide after drinking bleach, or even customizing your miserable self before you pass on, this game is always adding fun stuff.  Let's be real, for its price, this game really makes up for it.

5486111,428370,Windlands,"If you want to buy this game because you remember how great the old Oculus demo was, don't. They ruined it. Nicer graphics, worse gameplay!   For starters, you can only grab the leaves on the tree. So about 99% of the game is off limits for your grappling hooks. Tree bark, dirty, craggy rocks... NO. Just leaves. ONLY LEAVES!   They also removed the teleporter spikes that were so important to reaching those hard-to-reach locations. Those spikes were AWESOME because they let you setup your own checkpoints, wherever you wanted. Now all it has are generic checkpoint gates, which are few and far between. Get ready to retrace ALOT of your steps.  And don't plan on enjoying all of that retracing. The game is now heavily focused on, of all things, WALKING! The entire 'hook' of the game are the grappling hooks and they want you to spend half the game walking! What were they thinking???   I really wanted to enjoy this game, it's trilling to swing around like Spiderman or Tarzan, but they've took a great original game and poisoned it with ill fitting and outdated gaming convention. I really miss the old game! The whole game kinda feels like it was hijacked by somebody other then the original developer. Or maybe the original developer didn't understand what a gem is was before. Whatever the case, it's been thoroughly trashed.",-1,1

The controls can be a bit wonky, and when you get flustered you just end up spamming ♥♥♥♥ (which usually works much like mortal kombat and street fighter)  My biggest complaint is when you die, the checkpoints can be few and far between. So say you just got done killing some big dude which took 3 minutes, then cleared through a zerg wave which took another 3 minutes, then you accidently clicked the wrong damn button and dropped a giant ♥♥♥♥ing icefire stone on your face....

The game is a bit too real with the driving physics when you actually control it, except for when you randomly drive up and over cars. The default controls are the weirdest I've seen from any game. The graphics can be stunning, but I'm not able to use it. The developers should try to make the coding more efficient so the game lags less, that should be their focus. Should add coarses, add currency, and add street racing. Again AMAZING GRAHPICS. Needs work.",-1,0

I like Michonne and it's quite enjoyable to play. Slaying zombies, seeing stupid people die, .... but it's interchangeable. The characters are flat. The story is straightforward.

It is a super mario clone with OK controls, but ramps up the timed jump difficulty pretty quickly, which I find more frustrating than fun. Personally, I'd prefer if it were easier. The character control was decent, but not great. It felts a lot more like playing a mario knock-off from the old Commadore64 days, but a little tigher and modern graphics. I rather enjoyed levels 1-4. But I grew frustrated with the timed jumps required in the 2nd half of level 5, and suddenly it wasn't fun anymore. I had really hoped the fun wouldn't end until later levels.  It worked fine with an xbox360 gamepad, but first thing had to remap the buttons via its menus to something more intuitive to me (A=jump, B=dash, X=fire). The level select screen doesn't support gamepad, but it works everywhere else. Also the continue screen only registered Y to select (with my configuration, but wasn't a button to configure).",-1,0

5581815,441550,STAR WARS™ Rebellion,"This game is so classic. I played this a lot eighteen years ago when I had the original CD-ROM with the hefty, well written manual (anybody remember the cool reference poster?). I am so glad that it is available on Steam and I am so glad that the problems that other reviewers reported earlier with upside down icons have apparently been resolved. This game works perfectly (well, I have had two crashes in 16 hours of gameplay, but saving regularly is quick and easy) and I got it for just a few bucks. I am also glad the game comes with a PDF of the original manual, but I wish it was a higher quality scan. Oh well!  I am having so much fun playing it again after all of these years and it's just as good. They only thing I will say negative about the game is that it has a really terrible interface. There are menus, sub-menus, scrollable lists, and tabs galore. There's lots of scrolling and hunting around for things, as well as lots of clicking to initiate things you want to do in the game; sending Han Solo and Chewbacca on an abduction mission, aided by a team of rebel infiltrators, to capture Darth Vader on Sullust, for example. The depth of this game and all of the many things you can do can really make it hard to keep track of all that you've got going on around the galaxy. At least the game provides a search tool that lets you find specific planets, personnel, or fleets pretty quickly.  Seriously, if you love Star Wars and strategy on a grand scale, you owe it to yourself to try this oldie-but-goodie.

First thing I did when i booted up this game is go to the graphics settings and change the graphics becuase my computer is pretty decent and can hold up most games at 100% graphic output. So I i figured why not put this up to 100% and see? I reasoned that it couldent be do demanding considering that the videos of this on youtube but the graphics at or below par. I planned a flight then hit start... less than 1FPS. unbealivable. so i put the graphics down to 50% because surly a monster of a computer can handle a dinky little flight simulator at 50% graphics right? WRONG i only got 4FPS. I then put it down to 0% all the graphics are now at minimal. I load up the flight and am dissapointed to see im still only at less than 20FPS i get into the air. and all i see are squares on the ground. youve go to be kidding me. low textures = huge block of a sigle texture.

Flight School did NOT come close to running smoothly, even when the graphics properties were turned down. How can a full flight sim run perfectly, but a basic sim is unflyable? My friend/neighbor has a similar PC setup and sees the same issue, so it's not my system, just runs wonky on certain setups I guess.

5585213,442080,Riders of Icarus,"Ok, I tried to like this game. I was really interested in the variety of tamable creatures, huge dragon fan as well. I was able to capture a couple creatures early on that were considered mini bosses and got my hopes up when I tamed a red maned wolf to ride around. Then I got to a point where this didn't happen anymore. Of course I'd want to ride a giant bear or spider, but no, those weren't tamable yet. Either due to level or lack of an item, and do they tell you... no. Just 'taming requirements not met'.   So now I have to figure out what I need in the beasiary, do they tell you that, no... If they did it was during one of the glitchy cut scenes or terrible tutorial with windows that pop up off to the side hiding part of your hud until you close them, which of course you will because you're being attacked by a random mob that noticed you during the dialogue. Really though, how hard is it to say 'Taming requirements not met: Level XX required' or 'Taming requirements not met: Generic item 27 required'.  So what it felt like to me, is that I will 'eventually' get the items I need to tame them, but at that point I'll likely have a dragon, and then on the 2nd day they give you a raptor which is faster than just about anything you can tame at that point, defeating the purpose entirely.  Also, note to the developers, especially early on, put crafting stations at each encampment with a recall station. The game would have felt more in depth, more involved, and given an edge to those who put in the time to learn crafting, IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO GO TO THE CITY EVERY TIME TO CRAFT SOMETHING AND FILL YOUR MINISCULE INVENTORY.  On top of this, by LV.15 I ran into a wall. I had done EVERY SINGLE ONE of the sidequests possible, upgraded my current equipment as much as I could, and still ran into small bosses that I wasn't even getting half way through before I dropped. I can understand close to LV.30 needing to party up, but within a few hours you're forcing me into this?

5628033,445420,Aselia the Eternal -The Spirit of Eternity Sword-,"Part Fire emblem part Clannad. This game is what set the bar for a great visual novel. The strategy portions of the game actually will effect the outcome of the story, and the interplay of the story and strategy make you pretty invested into the troops. It isn't some generic spirit mook you are fighting with it is the cute and shy Hellion, and knowing about her makes you sad if you can't bring her home safe ;;   The one thing I would say as a complaint is some of the missions are too damn long, which is ok for a pure strategy game but as the whole game is pretty much one long war campaign it seems like the missions that are super long could have been subdivided into smaller tasks with story breaking it up. Now there are some that sorta do that... kinda... but it stays in the strategy mode engine which doesn't let you save when they are talking and only gives the profile icons for people talking so it isn't as immersive as the visual novel mode engine, which has voice acting and quick saving.  Anyway. The game is great. if you like visual novels or strategy games like fireemblem or super robot wars, this is a must.",1,0

5629485,446040,BLADE ARCUS from Shining: Battle Arena,"Extremely basic combat system, characters are very by numbers, very little content and mediocre online. Save your money for something else.  EDIT: The best thing I could say about the game is that is functional but nothing about it sticks out enough to make it memorable. The animations can look clunky at times and the characters animations seem inconsistent between some characters and it doesnt even look like its a stylistic choice Not a single character stands out and for most of the part in terms of designs are anime 101 and its depressing considering the game is based on Shining Series even if its taking characters from modern Shining games and not the older ones which had more variety visually speaking and less of the troupe characters we see in here which are pretty much generic for most of the part. The combat system I would consider it pretty basic as fighting games go and compared to other games in the genre there is not much systems and spectacle to talk about. The game feels pretty dated and even older games than this one feel better to control and more fun to play.   There is a tag team mechanic which is functional and similar to Marvel Vs Capcom or Skullgirls where you call up your partner and they make an attack which sometimes help out or not depending the type of character helping as some have crappy range or are too slow and easy to evade. The regular combat outside of the game is pretty much standard 2D fighting game with the combos and special moves which is good in sense of familiarity but in the end doesn't do much to set itself apart from other games that do the same things better technically speaking in a gameplay and visual department. Also not a big fan of the slower pace the game has and I normally dont mind slow pace fighters but this one simply doesn't bring anything interesting to keep going at it.  The resolution being locked to 720p is quite jarring considering the year we are on and how it shouldn't be much work for the developers to make the 1080p+ resolutions there. The online experience I had with the game was pretty bad but apparently got fixed so I cant really update anything there since my experience with it was poor and didnt get to try the improved on cause the offline game didn't give me much reasons from the gameplay standpoint or games modes as the game is pretty barebones in terms of single player content and options overall. Story,Versus and Training if I remember correctly is all the things the game offers. I get the game probably didn't have a big budget but there are other fighters that are considered 'poverty' fighters that feature more content and more fleshed out mechanics and unique characters to draw you in while this one feels like the skeleton of a game that is still work in progress.  As for closing I think the game is doing nothing memorable and at best average game that doesn't do anything to stand itself from other games in the genre and lacking modes and extras to keep you going at it. I find it a bit frustrating cause there is potential for the game with polishing some things from animation to character designs and re-balancing the speed and maybe throwing in a new mechanic or two. When you get games like Under Night In-Birth Exe Late that released recently on steam that gameplay wise pretty is really polished and has its own unique mechanics that separate it from other 2D fighters and has decent content for offline play from some modes to outfits to purchase for the character and decent online play its hard to look at this and pretend is a good game since the game is not doing anything special and what is doing is not particularly good at it.",-1,1

5630195,446560,Just Dance 2017,"Pros : - One of few games in Steam that makes you do workout instead of sitting all day. - Many selections of songs (about 50 built-in + more than 200 from Just Dance Unlimited). - The respond and accuracy is very good (better than Just Dance Now). - You can pay for Just Dance Unlimited subscription either from Credit Card or Steam Wallet (I like the latter option, since I don't have credit card). The subscription price is more or less same than Just Dance Now subscription price. - Many modes, so pretty high replayability (apart from that many songs selection). - Full control of smartphone (no need to use keyboard). - Up to six or eight player (assuming they have smartphone for each player). - 11 Uplay badges (most of Uplay games only have 3 badges). - Playable even on my GT540M laptop (no need to focus on this game's system requirement). Intel IGP devices may not supported.  Cons : - Limited screen resolution (especially if you use non-standard laptop resolution such as 1366x768). No setting for this one, so you either choose 720p or 1080p (idk about any other resolutions beyond 1080p). Disregard this thing if you intend to play on your external monitor with 1080p support. - Minor bugs if you play Just Dance Unlimited songs with slow internet connection.  Tip : - If you have dual graphic card (especially Intel and nVidia), make sure you set it to run with your nVidia. You must do this manually (as time of this writing), otherwise your game will crash because the game will try to run on your Intel. - If you have smartphone with x86 architecture and seeing blackscreen after Ubisoft logo, try to press back button.  My personal rating : 9,6/10 (Best Workout Game at Steam).",1,0
5630851,446800,Transport Fever,"I really want to like this game. I love OpenTTD and was hoping desperately that this could live up to it. And while, yes, the graphics are nice and all, the gameplay doesn't quite compare. First off, there is no AI opponent or even multiplayer. This may not be a big deal to everyone, but it was very fun to play against friends or a challenging AI in OpenTTD. Secondly, this game needs some optimization. While trying to place railroad tracks that go for more than 50 feet, I go to about 20 FPS. This is horrid considering I'm running the game on only medium to high settings. If multiplayer or AI was added along with optimization I would recommend this game. (Also the music is really good)  Specs:  Intel I7-4790k  GeForce 980Ti 6gb 16GB RAM Running off an SSD",-1,0

5633224,447020,Farming Simulator 17,"Nice improvement over 2015. Some mods available for 2015 are now standard in 2017. The graphics are slightly better, and a nice group of new vehicles/equipment including some new types of equipment (conveyors etc). FINALLY we have more animals (pigs) instead of just sheep, cows, and chickens.   The only Cons I will give are the maps and the in-game map system. In the 2015 and earlier versions you could pull up the map, see your equipment all over the place and click on anything and be instantly taken to that piece of machinery. In 2017, you can't. The map does nothing more than SHOW you where they are. You can either drive over to them in another vehicle or tab through until you land in the machine you want. Also, the default maps kind of stink. As a US based person, I only have interest in the US themed map and it is poorly laid out. A very, very small home-base farm with little to no storage for equipment (and no place to put additional storage) and fields all over the place. The geography is a very poor representation of most US farm land. The 'town' itself is nicely laid out though and very well detailed to look American.  The train system is a nice addition, but I feel it is a bit uneccessary. Also, the trains themselves are European styled so they don't fit in at all on an American map.  I will play this game much, much more when there is an add-on MOD map that I like made available. Until then, I'll just wait and see because as I said the US map is just too annoying for me to play on.",1,0

5644691,449020,The Bottom of the Well,"The worth of the time you spend on this game is how willing you are to work towards either the 'True' ending or the Achievements and until Guides are made for the game, that's going to take a great deal of Trial and Error.  For a free game, this game has some interesting moments, and if you are looking for a visual novel that's gritty and depicts what things may well be like when The Bombs Hit, then Bottom of the Well is a good game for you. However, parts of the game can be frustratingly vague. For example, I had died at some point and unlocked a portable Crowbar, but as I ended up playing 'Dark Alice' just trying to find out what could and could not be traversed/overcome, there was no point where it was necessary and it felt awkward to put on.   A lot of times I end up getting very similar endings to previous runs, either something like 'So Close' or making one bad decision or waiting something out and then dying of Radiation Poisoning. Until a guide comes out depicting how each ending is achieved, you WILL see these endings a lot.  The game mentions a Save function, but I sure as hell can't find it. Also if you try starting a new game too fast, the game won't process it correctly and you'll be forced to restart the client (count to 4 after the main menu shows up, and you should be fine, might have something to do with how I put it on 'Fantastic' graphics which, honestly, I question where Graphics even come into play in the main game.) Group and Social Dynamics in the game are laughable, they seem more like a narrative crutch than an actual mechanic within the game itself.  Also Inventory can be... really stupid honestly. Dark Alice doesn't have the same issues that Default Alice does and while the game recommends you play Default Alice first, Dark Alice is much better to get a feel for the game and what you can/cannot accomplish.  I haven't spent long on this game... an hour, hour and a half? I mean it's a good game, and if you like trial and error to find the way to your ideal ending, then that's great! Until a guide is made for this game though (and so far there's just a paultry first playthrough where the player fails to reach adequete shelter in time) I cannot, in good faith, recommend this game to others as there is no clear path (and even Default Alice herself offers very little hint on how exactly to accomplish the True Ending, much less other endings)",-1,1

5647151,449300,Planar Conquest,"tl;dr version: Planar Conquest is probably the most uninspiring 4x game I can remember and I've been playing them since the original Civilization. I played the original Masters of Magic (and remember waiting for Microprose to send me a patch disk in the mail so it would work). This is no Masters of Magic.  The original WoM has an attrocious Metacritic score and a Steam review score under 50%. Sadly, PQ is destined to share the same fate.  ------  Long version: I've held off commenting prior to now because I hoped PQ would get better prior to release after playing it in beta. I'm sad to say that it hasn't. PQ may very well be - with the exception of Stardock's original Elemental that didn't work at all - the worst 4x game I've played in the last 25 years. I'm not trying to be mean or subscribe to hyperbole. It's an informed, measured opinion and I simply can't think of a more uninspiring, clunky 4x game than this.  Someone commented that if Mircroprose made a sequel to MoM in the 90s it would look like PQ. They're right. The graphics are - and I'm not kidding - something I would have been disappointed in around the time of Civ 3. Here's a sample screenshot with every setting on max:    http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007300752/screenshot/447359296984739818   I don't find them appealing AT ALL and I actually quite liked the visual style of Worlds of Magic. Actually, I really liked the visual style of WoM beyond the fact you couldn't zoom out. Now you can zoom out but it looks like a bad tablet game and it looks even worse in motion. The ground textures are muddled and bland. The units look blocky, generic and unintersting. The whole art style has taken a massive step back. The UI is quite ugly, click-heavy and obtrusive without actually being helpful. At least they added right and left clicks ot the UI finally.   Sounds and music are fine. Generic but acceptable.   The biggest issue is simply the gameplay. I asked Les - whom I have a lot of respect for - a simple question during beta. Why should I play this over AOW3? I really didn't get much of an answer then and I haven't found one since. The gameplay is exceptionally generic and bland. The prime limiting factor continues to be gold as it was in WoM. If you have enough gold all is fine. If you don't, you lose. That makes things like city placement exceptionally boring - find the most gold or otherwise you can't support your city to build the advanced units. City spam has been reduced somewhat from WoM with the 10 city soft cap but it's still the prime way to advance. The buildings are generic. With all of these factors I don't feel like I'm building an empire worth building.   I have yet to find any unusual, interesting spells to cast here. We've seen all of these before. Stoneskin. Fertile Soil. Bless. Repeat ad naseum. I don't really feel that I'm advancing in power. I feel like I'm researching the same spells I've researched countless times from many games. And when you cast a spell, well...in a magic game I should get a rush out of casting spells. Except the spell animations are probably the dullest I've ever seen. There's simply no way to adequate describe how bland they are. A little puff of red powder is supposed to convey a fire spell. Casting Fertile Soil results in....nothing. This is a cardinal sin of any magic game.  The tactical combat is miles less fun or interesting that AOW3 - it's still line up on an empty field and have at it. The AI still seems to dumb in both the strategic and tactical apsect o fthe game. Diplomacy still seems to be exceptionally limited. Thus far I have not encountered even one unique gameplay aspect that's been brought to the table. There's nothing here that's been done in a new or interesting way.   I simply can't find a reason to load up or play the game. Every single aspect of the game has been done, and done better, somewhere else. It has all the failings of WoM - a game with an attrocious Metacritic score and a sub-50% Steam score - all over again with (IMO) even worse graphics and a less friendly/attractive UI. There are no systems that have been substantially improved IMO and some things like the UI and spell animations that reflect the mobile port.  Comparing it to AOW3 is like comparing your local pizzaria's hand-crafted pie to the cardboard discount pizza you'd get in the frozen section of your supermarket.",-1,1

5650203,449800,Attack on Titan / A.O.T. Wings of Freedom,I can sadly not recommend this game even though i have really looked forward to playing this since i really enjoyed the anime and manga but the only downside about this game for me was that there is no mouse support (you can't use the mouse at all) so you are given the controls to look around with your numpad which was impossible for me to utilise since nearlly all of my games are keyboard and mouse so i do not have the time to get used to a new play style and then i wouldn't be able to play my other games anymore because i would need to get used to the controls again and i also didn't want to buy a controller i mean i got on pc for a reason i mean what am i a 12 year old.

5683577,457680,OPUS: The Day We Found Earth,"Developers or Moderators deleted forum post which contained feedback and feature requests I thought would be beneficial to making gameplay more interesting.  This is the first time I've had this happen. Maybe it was a mistake, I can't say. But as I get the impression they do not appreciate user feedback, I cannot recommend the game on that alone. However even if that wasn't the case, in my suggestions I brought up several things that impact this game in a negitive way.  This game has a pretty solid story. But the pacing it terrible.  You play a small robot looking for earth. You search for it by aligning your telescope using the mouse or keyboard to grid coordinates or a general 'In this area kinda', type instructions given to you by the computer.  You scan stars in the area you think the match is in until you find a planet that is a high percentage match of earth, but is not really earth.  You do this over and over again, with little variation in play, in between each star, you are shown a view of the ship and read through some dialogue, mostly about how the robot misses it's friend.  Your character appears in multiple locations on the ship as you progress and unlock new areas. However, these areas serve no other purpose in the game besides a different background to read more dialogue.  I felt like there are so many missed opportunities that would have made this a great game.  For example, incorporating zoom and focus into the telescope. Piloting the ship and repositioning it. Really, by the 10th planet that wasn't earth, I was really feeling antsy and begging for the game to give me some other task to do.  Bestowed upon you about 1/3rd through the game, is a computer aided locator, which lights up on average 3-5 possible stars that are the one you need to scan. This actually made the game even less fun because it removed difficulty from gameplay instead of increasing it.  Towards the end, you are given one new mechanic. It consists of a filter, which shows something similar to IR light when looking at space. The game has you use this about 3 times total before the end of the game and tells you when you need to use it.  Really I understand wanting a story based game and a casual experience. But in my opinion the dialogue felt more like it took me out of the experience more than made me hopeful to hear more story. This is mainly because you listen to more dialogue in the game after EVERY SCAN of an earthlike planet. Which means about once every 2 minutes. Most of this dialogue is not worth interrupting the player, showing the ship, and going through more dialogue.  This filler dialogue should be spaced out and for the non essential stuff, it should happen while you are looking for things and during scanning.  Once you finish the story. You unlock Normal mode. Where you can spend time clicking on random stars and scanning them. All gameplay functions in both Story and Normal Mode are as follows: Pan Up/Down/Left/Right, Filter On/Off, Scan.  This gameplay mode offers you nothing new, other than to continue scanning the 100,000,000 star systems in the game and naming them. Literally the most feedback the game offers is a random percentage of how close that planet is to earth, a picture, and a description of why it doesn't support life or isn't like earth. Once you finish the story I don't see much point in playing in normal because at the core, it just isn't varied enough to be fun.  I think this had so much potential. I am sad to see parts of this game that just have a failed execution. I hope the developers rethink some of the mechanics and make the experience a bit more captivating and varied. All the foundations are there. If they do I'll be sure to change my review.  Currently however, this plays more like a visual novel with a hidden object mini-game. That would be the best way to go into this I think.  I will give the game credit though. It does have a really nice graphical feel. Soothing music. A unique direction and above all, it's got a lot of heart. But for the reasons above, that heart just isn't enough for me. I would give it shot if scanning the sky in the game in a casual and very basic fasion sounds fun to you, but I think that after the story you'll probably never touch it again. That is what bums me out because this has an opportunity to be something really special.",-1,1

5691999,460920,Steep,"While the game is stunning in visuals and sound design, it lacks in content, consistency, and overall enjoyment.  Exploration:  For a game that encourages the player to explore, the exploration and freeroaming is extremely tedious. The fastest mode of transportation is you wingsuit, but there are only so many places you can launch from. However, your faster ways to move can only move you downwards. To climb a slope, you have to use the paraglider or just walk. The paraglider still confuses me because it seems you have to find updrafts in specific places to boost you upwards, and there is no way to find these other than just mindlessly floating around until you run in to one. The walking is the most controllable of the five sports, but is insanely slow. Like, I know, running in snow is tiring and hard to do, but when the only way to ge to where I want to be is walking, I'd rather not be moving at two miles per hour.   Rocks: The rocky bits of the mountains are extremely annoying. While on the snowboard, even standing still on a bit of rocks will make you fall over. This places you in an endless cycle of falling over until you hold tab to try again. This means, even if you've been exploring for thirty minutes straight on your board, the game will plop you right back to the last time you switched sports. You also cannot transition from snow to rock while walking, and vice versa. This means if you flop and land on a patch of rocks, you cant just walk over and climb off, you have to slide off on you snowboard and fall over just to get off of a pebble you got stuck on. Oh, and you want to try again after that whole situation? Nope, the game will send you right back onto that rock, because you switched sports, remember?  Menus: The menus could do with some redesigning. The mountain view is difficult to navigate with all the places the cursor locks on to, and the view angle changes every time you open the menu, so it is very disorienting. It took me about twenty minutes to figure out how to view my replay for a manditory mission. I was also about three hours into the game before i realised that you could actually customize your rider.  Missions: There are some interesting missions called 'Mountain Stories' that I actually enjoyed, because they have a quick little story and a unique prize at the end. There was one mountain story where you had to ride around and smash these little snowmen who would taunt you the whole way through, and at the end, you recieved a neat little evil snowman mask. Also, I should mention, there are four different 'classes' of rider you can become. Pro Rider, Freestyler, Bone Breaker, and Explorer. You must complete missions specific to that class to level it up. My favorite type of mission by far are the Bone Breaker missions. They are very unique and interesting while remaining fun and difficult. The wingsuit Bone Breaker missions mostly consist of flying through small caves and tunnels with multiple twists and turns. These missions are very difficult, but you dont get frustrated because any time you fail, you know it is of your own fault. The game isn't screwing you over in any way, you don't succeed due to you own capabilities. Pro Rider and Freestyler missions, on the other hand, are difficult because of your lack of control. If you are riding down a steep slope and hit a tiny bump, you go flying off into the air, and will most likely miss the next checkpoint, forcing you to restart the entire mission. The actual ramps in the game entirely destroy any momentum you had before you hit the ramp. They function more as speed bumps than anything else. Most of the time to complete these missions, you have to resort to getting off of your snowboard and walking through the checkpoints yourself.  Checkpoints/'Level' Design: As I explained previously, the tiniest bumps in the earth will rocket you off into space. So, in a mission that requires speed and pinpoint accuracy, why are they all so bumpy? When the mission requires maximum control over your rider, the bumps make your rider do little jump after little jump, removing your ability to turn, making you miss the checkpoint, and restart the mission entirely. May I also add that these mission are extremely long and tedious, and one little slip will send you flying down the slope past all of your objective while you do your best to slow down. (Also, if you manage to fall over on any kind of slope, the ragdoll will fall all the way until it runs into a flat surface, and once it's there, it may continue to roll along being propelled by some unknown force, completely ignoring friction.) Okay, back to the checkpoints. Your next checkpoint is only revealed to you once you pass through the point before it, and when you're rocketing down a mountain at insane speeds, you hardly have time to react before you blow past it. Checkpoints are little spheres that you have to pass through the center of (no, you can't just touch it, you have to be entirely engulfed and then some) for it to count. This means it is very easy to zoom past over, or even through it without the game counting the checkpoint. There is, however a beacon that appears above the sphere to give a very vague idea as to where the point is. But wait! sometimes you find yourself in a little ravine where you can't see the beacon at all! You make a wrong turn to where you assume the next point will be, and whoops! You have to do the whole thing over again. A fix for this would be a minimap. Just a small little minimap that points you to the next checkpoint along with the beacon and sphere.  Leveling/Content: I have played about twelve hours of this game as of now, and I am level 22 out of 25. I have discovered all the lines that I could want to ride, and played all the challenges that didn't frustrate me to the point of quitting. Twelve. Hours. It may seem like a long time in text, but to me, playing the game, felt like about thirty minutes of casual playing. You may argue that, 'there's so much left to explore at the base of the mountains!' but where's the fun in that? It's not like it's gonna be some intense underground tunnel that leads to a huge slope with heaps of huge jumps and ramps. It's going to be a nice little group of cottages where you stop for a second and say, 'Neato,' before sliding off down the slight decline that the base of the mountains is.   Okay. Now, I know I just ranted on and on about what I don't like about the game, but overall I still had a good time. The game was beautiful with great sound design and song choice, and just boarding down a slope with no objective is calming and can even be rewarding. But, for the amount of unfair difficulty and bugginess and frustration this game has given me, it simply is not worth the cost of a full price game. It provides short lived wonder and beauty followed by grinding and inconsistency and frustration. I can not say that I recommend purchasing this game. ",-1,0
5693083,461560,Mandagon,"Great game. Let's do a quick pros and cons.  Pros: - Takes almost 0 time to download. 38 mb is all. - Great atmosphere. The music, the windhowling. It all comes together great. - Heartfelt story. I'll avoid spoilers, but it's safe to say the story is a great message. - Surprisingly ejoyable graphics and animations. The smooth movement never felt jarring and the little touches to the environment made it overall pleasureable to look at.  Cons: - TO DAMN SHORT!!! Don't get me wrong, I loved everysecond and found it completely worth the time. This is a great game. However, I really think Blind Sky could be on to something here. A non stressful game genre that's focused heavily on just enjoying the experience without much fear for failure.   Overall: 10/10. Just play it. It should take you no time to download and it took me less than half an hour to complete. Hands down, will become one of my favorite gaming memories.",1,0

5697951,462780,Darksiders Warmastered Edition,"Darksiders is a great action adventure game heavily inspired by the Legend of Zelda. The remaster looks great, but I can't recommend it since the audio in the cutscenes is off sync and there is a pretty infuriating bug in the latter part of the game that makes slogging through an already weak part of the game unbearable.   **Minor Spoilers to explain the bug** In the late stage of the game you get a portal gun which you will use in some of the boss fights, but there is a super annoying bug where you can't lay portals down when you are supposed to. I saw on the forums someone found a solution where you just have to look at item descriptions a couple times in the menu that will fix it which allowed me to get through 2 of the mini bosses. But, once I got to the final boss of the dungeon the bug got too obnoxious because the bug will reset every phase of the boss fight where your portals are supposed to reset. So unfortunately I'm probably done with the game.  I played this on the Xbox 360 when the game was released and don't remember these bugs, so if you want to play this great game you may want to play that version until they fix these bugs. That version does not have the updated graphics unfortunately though.",-1,0

5710519,467320,God of Word,"I came into this game expecting a colourful typing test to challenge the people with quick fingers. Instead it seems like an endless version of Words with Friends/Wordfeud. I will elaborate.  What I have played of the main campaign: You get into the game with no story (not that I would expect a story, just a point worth mentioning) You're set up with a minigame-esque sequence where you have to guess the right word, type a word with x amount of letters or something of the like, and after either succeeding or failing that you get on to the game. The game is, you're handed 7 letters and have to make as many words as you can from them, in order to deal x amount of damage to your opponent and that way be victorious. In the beginning it was interesting, but I quickly tired from doing the same thing over and over. Especially as it seems the campaign is a lengthy one and except the minigames offers little variation.  EDIT: There are apparently 10 typing game sequences throughout the campaign.  There are three other modes to speak of. -Endless word game which seems to be the campaign without variations or modes to it. -Endless typing game, which is closer to my expectations based on the video and images presented. Although this quickly becomes stale as well, as you have one scene of the main character attacking his enemies which come from the same direction and offer nothing new or enticing visually. -Multiplayer mode, which is a competitive online edition of the wordfeud mode, although that is currently dead/lackluster due to the missing player base (Saying that, do note that it might change in the future depending on how many people acquire this game.  So personally, expecting a typing test 'type' of game I was disappointed, as I was met with a game based on letter-combination. That being said, this game is well developed and with an interesting artstyle. It is just not for me, as Wordfeud and Words with Friends already exists and fulfills the interest for this kind of game. For people interested in a type-racer based game, I would refer to Typing of the Dead: Overkill.",-1,1

5726014,475150,Titan Quest Anniversary Edition,"  This version of the game suffers from the same problems the original had, gameplay wise. It is boring, very boring for the first few hours, and then it gets only slightly better. According to the fanbase, that is.  You kill enemies of a few archetypes, those who engage in melee combat, those who stay in ranged combat and a few mages, which use a few more abilites. Any enemy I've met has fallen into one of these archetypes, even the heroes. There has been not one battle that was even slightly exciting because all of the enemies seem to have the exact same attack pattern.  The combat feels off, too. Melee's fine, but ranged just feels clunky. I can't really describe it, but if you play it you'll notice. Quite often, your character seems to hesitate before an attack.  The skills are somewhat boring, especially if you compare them to Diablo II, which this game tried to piggyback on when it came out.  The soundtrack is nice, very relaxing and soothing, so not that fitting for an ARPG.  Actually, since Titan Quest lacks a lot of the A present in a typical ARPG, it atcually does fit. Some more music to play would have been great, since playing Diablo II's soundtrack somewhat harms the lighthearted atmosphere of this game.  I have no complaints concerning the graphics.  My recommendation is to avoid this game unless you have a saint's patience and don't mind investing a lot of time into an ARPG without knowing whether you're going to like it in 10 hours. Now that may not sound like much, but ten hours (+ 3 or so idling) felt like a very long time to me, and I have several hundred in Morrowind. Of course, you could mod this, but that deosn't make the combat any less clunky. I'd say go for Grim Dawn instead, it's made by the same guys who were responsible for this flawed gem, but much more playable and with much better pace.   EDIT: I forgot about the story because everyone cares about the story in this type of game. The premise is pretty interesting, Hell, the entire story is pretty great if only it had any actual impact on the world. Monsters overrunning Greece? Cities besieged and temples destroyed? Hardly visible in the game with birds chirping and some fat Greek in sandals caring more about his ugly daughter's wedding dowry.   http://www.grimdawn.com/forums/showthread.php?p=37225#post37225 ",-1,1

First off, every level in each world is the same and you fight the same 3 enemies of that world every level, which is super boring. Then you fight a boss which is just a bigger version of one of those enemies. The retry and store system is legit terrible. Buying the first shortcut cost 10k, and to get to it you need another 5k to buy triple jump. This means you can't use them, and if you die you have to repeat the same boring levels again and again. After buying the first gate I never spent another time and played through 4 worlds and still didn't even have enough to buy the gate for the world before the world I was on. This terrible design forces repetition due to lazy game design. Also buying gates means you cant buy other upgrades, not that you could anyways, as some cost 50k to 150k.

Other than a few really cheap kills ( a couple unavoidable) i'd say they have the monster design down well, and is pretty fair.  Little girls and horror are my favourite things when mixed together, and this game has a terrifically cutsey, yet gorey feel that I adore~ If you're looking for a pretty nice story with elements of horror, i'd say give it a go. And there's a lot of optional side tasks for you to find and complete, like chasing down headless chickens or playing tag with a horribly disfigured ghost child.   And as a last bit of advice, play with a controller, or rebind the keyboard controls. the defaults are unintuitive at best, though i can excuse it due to the game being a port of a psp game.  Overall 8/10",1,0

Apparently the connection to ubisoft is buggy in some way, but I wasn't able to fix that issue - it's steam's job to deliver fixes and patches, not mine. Ubisoft has stopped support for the buggy game, and an ubiplay account is needed to play. According to the newest ubiplay rules the game activation keys expire after 2 month of non-playing - that's not acceptable for a collector like me. So I've decided to return it to steam. Since I've bought a package with Silent Hunter 3 - 5 and played Silent Hunter 3 for a few hours before I tested Silent Hunter 5 and found it unplayable, steam refuses to take the game back.  So I've paid for an unplayable game which expires after 2 month. What a piece of impudence.",-1,0

5764117,48220,Might & Magic: Heroes VI,"I realized early that Heroes 6 is the weakest installment of the series. It has an utterly generic story that has nothing to do with the events of the previous titles and a gameplay that lacks any inspiration. But I could have ignored that, since, despite being not a very good title, the game still has some solid entertainment. What really killed it for me is the 'always online' issue, even if you really just want to play a single-player game and don't even care about multiplayer. While being always online in Steam is usually a non-issue, having to be always online on the notoriously unstable Uplay network can be a pain. Also if Uplay servers are down for any reason and you try to work around that by starting the client in offline-mode the game will begin giving you trouble. For example it will refuse to let you load any of your savegames, because games you played while you were online are not available when you are offline. And if it has a particularly bad day it will deactivate completely, tell you that your version of Heroes 6 is 'unregistered' and demand that you go online to register your already registered game another time before you are allowed to play the game again. So that's my real issue.  However, if you need another reason, then here is a word for those of you who just happen to be die-hard fans of the series like me: please take my warning. This game does NOT continue the events of Heroes 5 and/or Dark Messiah of Might and Magic. It is a prequel that surrenders the previous story-line completely. I mean: Bloody hell! It's not like Ubisoft left us with a cliffhanger after Heroes 5, where the dark messiah, possessed by a half-naked, smoking-hot succubus, stopped the necromancers and their alliance of the willing from dropping weapons of mass-destruction on the underworld, destroyed the skull of the seventh dragon to free the demon-lord and open the gates of hell. So that the dark lord would rise from the abyss speaking the magic words: 'I am your father'. You know - introduce some global warming: the lucifer-way. And right before we found out if the world was going to end and if beelzebub actually can be a picture-book daddy... curtains dropping! The end. And here comes Heroes 6 and it starts with the words '2000 years earlier'! Wait a minute, Ubisoft: I thought we just had some serious armageddon and succubus-action going on here! What happened to good old: smash skull first, eat brains later? So honestly: unless you are really desperate for another Might and Magic title, just skip Heroes 6 and wait for Heroes 7.

People in this game want too much. It also takes SO long to destroy something. It took something like 15 minutes for a battleship to destroy 1 of the five guns on a dock. What the heck!?

I used to own an Amiga 1200 and was desperate for Championship Manager to be released for the Amiga. When it was, however, it was something of a catastrophe.   Now I am reminded of those days.... BECAUSE that (obviously rushed) Amiga version featured a bug whereby the league table completely malfunctioned. And now ladies and gentlemen, that bug is back, some 20 years later. Just played my first match as Fortuna Sittard in the Netherlands. Played 1, won 1, GD +1, points 0. Could this be because for match 1 I played in full match mode?!! Why should that make a difference anyway? My previous version of FM was 2015 and that worked fine, although I reckon the best version I played was FM 2012 (truly a great game, virtually free of errors save for the occasional crash). If I was playing this game on a naff machine (which my 1200 was 20 years ago) I might think fair enough, what can I expect? But I have a top of the range gaming laptop less than 8 months old.  The issue could be that this time the designers have become so obsessed with the match engine and player high-res photos (pretty much a waste of memory) that either they neglected the general coding in the rush for release or they simply pushed the limits too far. Personally I couldn't care less whether the game looks as good as FIFA - the match graphics were good enough in 2012 and the constant addition of extra data and 'features' will naturally mean the game is going to have performance issues if graphics continue to be the main preoccupation. Please Sega, take a few steps 'back' to take a huge step forward for next year's version and actually give us a game that works!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",-1,0

5802705,48700,Mount & Blade: Warband,"I've played the hell out of this game. Though usually while stoned out of my mind so it's easy to just laugh and have fun. When playing totally sober though, the problems shine through. I should mention I'm talking about multiplayer only. The single player campaign is, meh, horrible. The towns feel 100% lifeless as do all the people including the NPCs you'll recruit.   Back to the multi... Big problems are archers and the feinting system. You can feint an attack, which takes time to learn to do well. The problem I have with it is that it looks stupid. The characters half swing the weapon, so it looks like a baseball player not taking a full swing at a ball, and not a sword fighting feint. I don't think this was intenional by the game designers, and was more or an expliot that was learned early on. 'Good players' will feint a lot, and look like morons. They'll kill you though, so you should learn the stupid ♥♥♥ feint so you don't just die ughh.  Then there's the Archers. Horse archers are the worst. They can simpy gallop at a slow speed ahead of you and continue to shoot arrows, while all you can do is die, or disengage them and hope they just go after someone else. Like regular archers, they're usually pretty idiotic in that they usually just stand still. Archers will spawn and immedietly just look for targets. This makes it easy to kill them because you can usually just walk right up to them and stab them, because they're never paying any attention to anything around them. Just spawn, shoot shoot shoot die, repeat. This makes being an archer boring, and killing archers even more boring. Sometimes you'll find some elite player being an archer which is hellish. They'll do the shooting game, BUT they actually pay attention and will pull a sword on you, and then, yup baseball feint you to death. This just comes off as them being cocky 'look at me, yeah, I'm just here leasurely killing people from afar but oh, hello there, let me show you how awesome I am by kicking your ♥♥♥ as an archer hahahaha'....   People complain sometimes of Cav players taking cheap shots like archers, but the Cav still have to come right up to you to kill you. Its much more personal and you have a chance to defend yourself if you were paying attention and didnt let them sneak up on you. No such luck with archers. Youll be walking and then just dead. A problem with this is that were's no cap on how many archers there can be, so if theres enough of them, things get really boring really fast, except for the archers which get a kick out of it.  Things would be good if the creators did anything with the game, but they don't. I believe they're making another which probably has their focus. So no changes ever happen. No fixes to the problems. These are my personal issues with the game, though I'm sure plenty feel similarly. Something like spawn killing is something I'm sure everyone despises but once again, will never change. In the Arena map, some archers will sit in a spawn area and just shoot newly spawned players, OR spawn, walk outside the spawn and then just do their sitting there thing. Never taking more than a few steps outside of where they themselves spawned before just shooting and shooting before some just walks up to them and kills them.   SO, play if you smoke weed. Which I do, and will be doing right about now before I go back to playing the god damn multiplayer. Like I mentioned earlier, I have played the hell out of the game. TONS of potential and the best swrod fighty sort of game out there. Way better than Chivalry or whatever those other complete horse ♥♥♥♥ games are.   ♥♥♥♥, so I should mention the mods. Like Brytenwalda. That is SO MUCH BETTER for single player. Like holy ♥♥♥♥, if you're gonna do the single player thing, just get that.

The graphics are pretty much par for a simulator released in 2010.. not really pretty, but they get the job done. The ship and water physics are very well done. A big ship really feels like a big ship. They take a long time to get going, and a long time to stop. I was towing a huge container ship out of port, and mis-timed a turn. Nothing could stop the ship from slamming into the seawall. The water physics are equally as good. I was taking a speed boat for a whirl, when I came up next to an ocean liner at full clip.. THE WAKE ACTUALLY PULLS YOU IN TOWARDS THE BIGGER SHIP.. as I approached the bow, the bow wake flipped my little boat over without mercy... 10/10, would drown again..  The missions are fairly varied, and can take 1-2 hours each. It is too bad that this game can't be modded, but there is enough content to keep you busy for awhile.

5821122,494440,The Amazing Shinsengumi: Heroes in Love,"I just came off a replay of Hakuouki, and was desperate for more interaction with the Shinsegumi. This game caught my eye initially because not only was it on sale, but the art was beautiful and even though I knew it wasn't at all connected with Hakuouki, I decided to give it a shot. Before I get into the review proper, a little note: I did my best not to compare this game with Hakuouki, since the two plots are pretty much night and day, and that's fine. The Shinsegumi are a popular subject for media material, so Hakuouki definitely didn't 'do it first' or anything.  That being said, let's start with the negative and end on the positive.  Negative: - The available guys all seemed to be in-love with the heroine from the moment they met her. This isn't exactly new for otome games of this nature, but most of them offer some sort of buildup. This one never did, and it was jarring.  - The heroine, likewise, seemed in-love with them right off the bat. I tried to rationalize it was her being swept up in the events of that night since they did just rescue her, but again it was weird.  - I wasn't expecting a deep, complicated plot when I bought this. But I also wasn't really expecting to finish every route, extra stuff included, in a couple of hours. A short game wouldn't bother me, if the plot was at least decent and the plot for this game just fell flat. It was the same thing, time after time, and each route only offers minor changes (in my opinion, at least).  - The soundtrack has some issues, which I've seen mentioned in other reviews. While not awful, the looping isn't done well and it's a little choppy, the way it shifts between tracks. This wasn't a huge issue, since I just turned the BGM off and listened to my own music, but still.  - No Hijikata route. I guess there was a trade off? We could romance Shinpachi here, but not Hijikata.  Okay, look, no bullet points for this complaint: I'll be honest and say forceful guys are not exactly a turn on for me when it comes to romantic plots. I don't mind if the guys are a little rough around the edges, but when it starts to become physical then it crosses a line I'm not comfortable with. I mention this because in this game, nearly all of the guys are extremely forceful in their attraction to the heroine. Given the period the game is set in, I am used to the guys being 'protective' of the heroine and holding her back, expecting her to listen to their orders. If that had been the case, I'd have overlooked it. That was, sadly, not the case.  I can't even remember the amount of times the situation turned sexual and the heroine spent most of it trying to tell the guy to stop. Most of them continually said it was 'her fault for being so cute' and that 'it seems like your body likes it' and I just, I was disgusted. Maybe it was translation? I'm not entirely sure and at this point, I don't really care. The only two options who didn't do this to such an awful point were Nagakura Shinpachi and Harada Sanosuke; the former was actually rather sweet and I'm glad I did his last, meanwhile the latter wasn't perfect but it was better than some of the others.  Souji and Hajime both had varying instances of these bad scenes; it was disappointing because outside of those scenes, Hajime's route wasn't awful. Souji's route left almost no impact on me either way, which is disappointing as he'd been my first pick.  Heisuke's route, however, made all of the others look tame. Now let me start off by saying that it was Heisuke's route that caused me to break my rule of not comparing this game to Hakuouki; in Hakuouki, Heisuke took me by surprise as being one of my top three routes, so seeing the way he acted here was...hard to swallow. His overall personality would have been fine, I'm not really into guys that act like bratty kids but, whatever. No, it was the way he treated the heroine. He was constantly groping her and basically violating any and all personal space boundaries.  That scene during the fire where he sexually assaults her? I had to walk away for a moment. It gets worse from there, and what's worse is even after spending so much time telling him no, in the end the heroine is in-love with him and accepts his actions. She does this in all of the routes, but not until Heisuke's did it just drive home how  awful  this game was at handling relationships. Again, I know that given the time period, women did not experience some of the freedoms we do now, and so when I play games set in these kind of settings I try to remember that. Does that mean I support plots that use sexual assault for the sake of drama and shock? Hell no. It also means I don't agree with notions of 'violence = love' which is an awful trope and shouldn't even be a thing.   It was just a huge slap in the face when after repeatedly telling him to stop, the heroine found herself liking his actions. She even tells him at one point 'no means no' and he then tries to guilt her into complaining about how she always tells him no. Ugh, if there was ever a moment I wished we could get refunds on games from Steam...  The positive aspects are pretty much what I stated earlier: the artwork was very lovely and the game was on sale. If I had to come up with another, I guess Shinpachi's route was pretty nice? I got the sense that he and the heroine did have some sort of connection, and even the scene where he had to strip her was given context, plus he clearly wasn't happy doing it. His route is the only one I can safely say I didn't mind playing.  Overall, this game was a huge disappointment and while I'd gone into not expecting much, I left with such a bad taste in my mouth. Every person is entitled to their own opinion, but I'd give this game a pass if you're considering it.",-1,0

5840714,49520,Borderlands 2,"This game has a lot of longevity, it is an FPS/RPG that is based around looting weapons and4 person coop (though it isn't required).   In terms of story this game is phenominal. It takes a very serious story and wraps it in a very unique brand of humor that is unique to borderlands. Though it is a sequel you don't need to have played Borderlands 1 to enjoy this game, though it may do you well to learn the basic plot and main characters. This game also features my all time favorite videogame villain, Handsome Jack, who you will no doubt love to hate. All combined, this game has a hillarious and somewhat moving story.   As for gameplay, The game does an incredible job of adding variety to the many quests you recieve. Unlike Borderlands 1, which was plagued by fetch quests, the quests in this game feature many different objectives ranging from killing minibosses to blowing up bandit cars. A key component to this game is looting new and exciting weapons and leveling up your character. You will constantly be finding new and exciting loot to power up your character. That being said, Some of the enemies are very repetitive and at times fighting them can be tedious.   DLC. This game contains a wide variety of DLC which includes 4 story addons, 2 new playable characters, and 5 short 'headhunter' DLC (Headhunter DLC is not included in the game of the year edition but can be bought seperatly). I won't review each peice of DLC individually, however, I will say that 'Tiny Tina's Assult on Dragon Keep' is now one of my favorite DLC's of all time. It is absolutely worth bying the Game of the Year edition.   While the developers did a great job with the game, They had a few short cominhs. I will say that the game does not center on teamwork (Skill trees will buff your character but don't provide ways to help others) and The level cap (which was raised through DLC to 72) is tedious to reach and will require 2-3 playthroughs of the game, each playthrough more difficult than the last, limmits how unique your character is by providing access to most of the abilities by the time you're done. Some people may like having the higher level cap, I personally do not.    All in all, this is a phenominal game and if you havn't played it yet, you are doing your self a disservice. i give this game a 9/10. It is a good point to jump into the franchise.",1,0

Resource management is practically non-existant, and the weapons system is based on a number of slots that can be upgraded over time. This system requires minimal effort, and though it appears to be a central point of the game, it just seems to be a clunky, poorly-built weapons wheel. The plot takes forever to move forward, and the side missions consist purely of kill and/or collect. Pardon me, but I'll stick with my bethesda rpgs.   Still, not to grossly underrate the game, it is still a fairly fun shooter, with a few elements of an rpg that are well done, for example the skill trees and character creation systems are well made, and offer a variety of specializations and appearances.

5845113,49540,Aliens: Colonial Marines,"Terrible letdown of a game. STAY AWAY FROM THIS AWFUL TURD OF SOFTWARE!  Poor enemy AI, uninteresting gameplay. The graphics are dated by about a decade: do not be fooled by Gearbox's Demo preview from 2012.  Multiplayer is no good either.  - Inability to mute people once the game begins  - No dedicated servers: very high latency, long wait to get into games. If the host leaves, the game dies (and you lose all your progress). Although i haven't seen any yet, hacing will be rampant in short order since SEGA appears to have abandoned the game at release anyways. - It appears to have a co-op, but requires you to play with 4 people, no less.",-1,0
5845231,49540,Aliens: Colonial Marines,"I recommend getting Alien:Isolation over this garbage that was hyped so much in the past. People are giving this positive reviews to try to revive this beaten, dead horse of a game. The graphics are terrible, AI is atrocious, gameplay sucks. story is vomiting, characters are forgetable.  Now there are some positive things. Aquiring legendary weapons from the aliens movie was awesome and gave me a bit a nostalgia. Also finding Hudson's body(Game over man!), and the sewer level. The sound is the best sound of all the alien games. The devs FINALLY got the sound of the pulse rifle right. And the iconic smartgun that makes me scream, 'LET'S ROOOCK!!!'   BUT, the smartgun can  only be found and used on certain levels  which ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off, because I love it as much as the pulse rifle. And the fight between the alien and power loader was a gigantic disappointment. All you do is hit and try not to get hit. Wasn't as bad as the final boss fight. Not going to spoil it for those who are playing it, just see for yourself. As said the AI is bad, on your side and the aliens. The aliens would just attack your partner, then suddenly just comes at you like your parnter never existed. And sometimes your partner just doesn't shoot, like he suddenly became a pacifist, leaving you to fend for yourself.  I played the multiplayer, it was fun, laggy but fun. I think its better than AVP because you don't have to worry about getting E spammed by alien/predator players or tail spammed to death, or speed hackers and aimbots...  Now, who is to blame for this abomination that was supposed to be awesome. SEGA? Gearbox? Timegate? Nerve? Demiurge? The answer is Gearbox. They have made 100% dedication to the game and even displayed the demo and released it. They even made appearences promoting the game and preaching how gearbox is gonna make the best aliens game and people will enjoy it. Then they put these other gaming developers in charge of doing the single player, the story, the multiplayer, which left this game a giant train wreck leaving Sega wondering what happened. And yes it's also sega's fault for wanting to rush the game in the first place so the fault goes to them along with gearbox. However, Sega made up for it with Alien:Isolation.  Overall, if you are a hardcore fan of the aliens franchise, I would pick it up. If not, don't pick it up. Do not buy it;even if its on sale for 99 cents. Give that money to the homeless.",-1,0

5845857,49540,Aliens: Colonial Marines,"Aliens Colonial ♥♥♥♥- I mean Marines. A game made by the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ developers Gearbox. Colonial Marines is the canon sequel to the great movie Aliens. This game has been in development since 2008. Basically the game is horrible, its ugly, the AI is stupid, and the story SUCKS! Gearbox used the money that SEGA gave them to make Borderlands 1 N 2 so they outsourced most of this game to Timegate. They received the game back 9 months b4 release and GB didnt like it. So they scratched their game and started all over. If this game feels like its only been developed in under a year its becuz it has. Im not even going to talk about the story cuz its horrendous. The gameplay is also not that great either, its feels so clunky and boring. For most of the game you don't even fight Xenos you basically fight Weyland Yutani soldiers for 80% of the game. The game Should be called 'Soldiers: Colonial Marines cuz u basically fight them and thats it. It feels like they try to pander to the call of duty crowd. It feels like CoD in space, seriouisly who the hell uses iron sights on a pulse rifle. I dont remember any of that crap in the movie. Any ways dont waste your money on this game its not even worth anything. GB also is trying to take more of you rmoney with its shiity season pass and BugHunt Dlc which shouldve already been in the game. It is a horde mose basically of course it shouldve been in the ♥♥♥♥ING GAME DUMBASSES. Horrible everything about it, GB can go ♥♥♥♥ themselves.",-1,0

5848007,495910,Dungeon Fighter Online,"DFO is, quite frankly, one of the best games I've ever played. I played during the turbulent Nexon years. I lived through it closing and stumbling through the Chinese version. I played through the open alpha and finally now, where Neople, the original developers, publish the game globally by themselves.  And this is the best version of DFO we'll ever get.  My Steam says 6.4 hours, but over the course of the game's lifespans I've easily sunk 750+ hours across a bunch of characters.  Pros: Character classes are all fun to make and play, as each 5 levels gives you new skills to toy with and combo with.  Plenty of character slots to use, with more given out for free all the time.  Biweekly events to help players get useful items like life tokens, safe upgrades, even avatars and equipment.  Neople is extremely quick to respond to the playerbase when issues arise and compensate very well.  PVP is a blast.  The XP curve is so much better now, and Scenario dungeons make the once-awful grind mighty doable.  Co-op with up to four players, or PVP with up to 8 in 1 on 1 matches or all-out brawls.  You can play dress-up.  The official anime is absolute garbage, but it's so funny to watch as a result. Spot-the-anime-cliche!  You can get most cash shop items from events or from other players.  A point shop where you get points for running dungeons/from events/rebated from cash shop purchases, which you can use to buy helpful items and a limited range of avatars.  Lost Treasure keys actually drop fairly frequently, compared to never seeing a key fragment drop ever in Nexon days.  Extremely moddable. You can replace background music and even the sounds the characters make. I have the old Nexon English voice packs, plenty of old dungeon music, and my Mechanic's Combat Robot blasts Darude - Sandstorm instead of its original song every time I crit.  SKILL RESETS ARE FREE AND THERE'S A SKILL TREE! SCREW YOU NEXON FOR MAKING PEOPLE PAY TWENTY DOLLARS FOR A DAMN SKILL RESET  Gold is fairly easy to obtain and costs for leveling equipment isn't prohibitive. Hell, Epic quests pop out equipment for your characters every 5 levels.  Extremely controller friendly. I have Xpadder set up with a PS2 controller and use the game's input commands system to activate most of my skills.  It's not Mighty Number 9.   Cons: Fatigue. A lot of people complain about it, but it's a necessary evil to help protect the game's economy, which is actually still pretty healthy compared to Nexon days. Still, it can be a bummer to get to a new dungeon or brand new skill and have to wait or use a fatigue potion to play with it.  Only can make 2 characters a day, which is only really a con before you have enough alts to deal with fatigue if you want to play more.  Avatars are untradable, except in the special packs that other players can buy and sell. You have to cash shop or point shop these. Dammit nipple I just wanted a shirt for my Slayer.  Some classes don't do as much damage as other classes as easily, this can be kind of discouraging. Ranger is weaker seeming than Launcher, for example. Though Ranger is still absolutely fun as hell, and got a buff/rework recently that makes him better without a reinforced weapon. And, if he gets a powerfully reinforced weapon, he can easily outdamage the Launcher late-game. Play what you enjoy, not what the community says is good.  Connection in PVP is pretty important if you wanna get real competitive.  The people that buy global chat megaphones are either selling things or absolute idiots. It can be funny, or it can be grating. At least Megaphones are now 2 Mileage points instead of the...what, $5? they were in Nexon.  If you want the absolute best equipment ever for facerolling PvE content, you gotta beat the odds of winning the lottery five times in a row. That said, you can do plenty fine with a good set of Chronicle armor and a nice pink weapon.  The game does not tell you about Quick Rebound. For the sake of God, pick up Quick Rebound. It's in the top bar of skills in the skill window.  The constant flow of events can be overwhelming; Just remember you DON'T HAVE to do all of them if you don't want.  All of the stuff in the game can be daunting to new players, but it gets easy to understand after a few days.  The game doesn't automatically enable Tutorial mode for new players. Do yourself a favor and hit O, then navigate to System and enable Tutorial mode.  The Global chat is NOT indicative of the community. Come find us at  reddit.com/r/dfo  for help and info.

5879432,50130,Mafia II (Classic),"Overwhelmed by all the positive reviews i decided to pick this game up, and while i consider the game to be above average, there are alot of things that this game lacks.  To sum it up for you guys that dont want to read the possible spoilers: the cons outweigh the pros, and i cannot agree when people say this game is awesome, because it isnt, its overall a decent game and even though i give a thumbs down, i do recommend you try it, but if you want to do so, pick it up on a sale, becuase this game is basicly a GTA DLC.  *SPOILER ALERT* some of the pros and cons will be based on things happening in the story, but i will try to keep it short.  Pros: The story is quite good. The game does a good job of capturing that mid 1900s feeling. The music quality is good. The combat mechanics feel rather simple, but fits the game quite well. The speed limiter function while driving.  Cons: The games story is over in 8 hours playtime. The non-story content more or less consists of running around looking for magazines and posters. Cars handle quite awfully overall on pc, which is a big deal since most of your time is spent in a car. There is no free roam. You can start a chapter and muck about, but nothing you do matters. You can get a heap of cars and tune them, which in itself is good, but it is a waste of time since you lose it all anyway. Same thing with clothing, you can set up a nice wardrobe, but its pointless. I was waiting the entire game for the possibility to buy things for/upgrade my home, but it never came. The gunshops are completely useless, there were never anything i could buy from them that i didnt already have. There is no diversity in the shops in the game, everyone sells the same things everywhere. There are gas stations all over the city, but i have never had to refill the tank of my car, so why are they interactable?  Conclusion: There are so many features in this game that are implemented but doesnt actually contribute anything whatsoever to the game, i cant help but think that the devs just didnt have time to finish this game properly. The general feeling of the game is that of a DLC, and not a standalone title, so, get the game on a sale, finish the story, and when you are done, toss it in the thrashcan, you are better off playing anything else after that point.

The bad:  With physx turned on, it runs like ♥♥♥♥ even on a 970, with constant dips as low as 35fps. The gameplay only seems to serve the purpose of filling the gaps between the cutscenes. The world isn't very interactive.  The save system is garbage, with only predefined auto saves points.    This really would have been better as a movie or miniseries. There just isn't much of a game here. It's not bad, but it's existence as a game seems pointless. The fact that it's $32 6 years after release is absurd. ",-1,0

It takes a fairly tired genre (third person corridor shooter) and gives it some life with its interesting story, location, and set pieces. I've never seen a game set in Dubai before, and not only that but a post-apocalyptic Dubai. The art direction, with the super-modern architecture submerged in sand, and at odds with the war tearing the city apart, is very well done. The gameplay is designed to be disturbing- you mostly just kill other American soldiers, playing as an American soldier, and are forced to make hard decisions, and kill civilans in terrible ways, in order to achieve your goal. The set pieces somewhat reminded me of Bulletstorm, in that you frequently rope between the rooftops of 50 story buildings, or slide down collapsing skyscrapers, that sort of thing. It's very Heart of Darkness inspired in terms of the story, and in testing the morality of the main character.

The game has full controller support for a reason: it just doesn't support mouse &amp; keyboard. Or rather, it does but all the prompts ingame are for controllers even if you don't have one plugged in, effectively forcing you to play with one. And as you all know, shooters with a controller are just garbage to play. Plus the cover mechanics are unresponsive at best, which makes the game a lot harder than it would be if the controls were decent.

If you get a silver score, you can get music in game for free and no need to get the soundtrack, you can buy it, or you can earn it. (also artwork and some other stuff) 2. If you right-click you hold up a torch to light zombies a blaze. This is usefull to get a multiplier to gain more points, also the zombies are easier to kill, but the zombies are faster and stronger, it such a great mechanic. 3. If you get three combos, you can press the button (which is in the middle of the map) and it can help you kill some zombies (But in the woods, it is not usefull) 4.

5904346,506140,Shop Heroes,"I played this game for many hours on Facebook, but became increasingly frustrated. Unless you are willing to spend a considerable amount of real money on micro transactions you will find yourself very restricted in every aspect of the game.   Shop Heroes becomes extremely grindy and they have an absolutely tear-your-hair-out mechanic, where your hero's items break on nearly every series of quests. You can spend gems (real money) to repair them and at much higher levels there are skills and equipment that can counteract this - but good luck getting to those levels and acquiring the skills and equipment needed, without spending real money.  Sure, the game can be played without spending real money, but everything will take literally 10 times longer and the experience will be very frustrating. Additionally, all the best items in the game can ONLY be bought with real money. The game has potential and is an unusual take on the genre, but the execution falls well short of this potential.   Since this game is aimed at the mobile market, it has a very simple and inflexible UI, with many restrictions and missing many quality-of-life enhancements that one expects from PC games. It even keeps mobile type behaviour, like timing out after a few minutes of inactivity - useful in a mobile device to save battery, but frustrating and unneeded in a PC game.   One of the more irritating things about the UI is on the Auction House, you cannot separate out items being sold for gems as opposed to gold, requiring you to go through long lists of items to try find something affordable and useable. In generaly the AH UI is clumsy and clunky and rather restricive. You have extremely limited slots and quantities and a massive 3 day penalty if you try cancel a trade outside of a restrictive time window.  Naturally, all the best items for earning XP and gold/gems can only be purchased for real money, with no way to acquire them otherwise.

This game reminds me of the Legacy of Kain series for its dedication to full cutscenes, great dialogue and memorable characters. Mark Hamill does an excellent job voicing the Watcher, but Samael steals the show as the demon who would be king...   Gameplay-wise, this is a God of War scenario with plenty of hacking, slashing, upgrading, messy execution moves and puzzle-solving. I'd recommend playing on Apocalyptic difficulty if you want a challenge, else it's a bit too easy for the average hack n' slash veteran.   I've had a couple of crashes, but there are autosaves galore, so picking up the pieces wasn't too irritating. You should definitely consider picking Darksiders up at sale price, as the £20 label is a bit much.",1,0
5907582,50620,Darksiders,"I played this game after playing through Darksiders 2 twice. To tell the truth I didn't really like this one, while I love the second game. It has to do with that this game is rather monoton and I didn't find it challenging at all after completing the second game. I didn't complete the game and I don't intend to complete this game soon, maybe in the future when I'm in the mood for such games. It's only a personal experience though. I can't complain much about it, because it has nice graphics with a fair system requirements. The combat system is a bit complicated at first, but you can get used to it very quickly. If you have a controller, you should have no problem with it at all. I recommend this game for those who like hack'n'slash and/or The Legend of Zelda games. Personally I liked 2 better, but I can't say that it is bad, because it isn't. It's just that I find it a bit boring.  I don't recommend for those: -Who want to farm achievements, because this game has a notorious bug, which makes you unable to unlock achievements. It can occur anytime and the only solution is restarting the steam. However, if the achievement is story related, and you already passed that part of the story, then it will remain locked as long as you pass that part again and the bug doesn't occur. (Partly I stopped playing because of this, because I'm sort of a completionist and I realized that it would be painful to get all achievements in this game) -Who expect a difficult a game. I started playing on Normal and it was easy to avoid taking damage. I tried the highest difficulty, which is apocalyptic, but the only thing, which got changed is, is the health and the damage output of the enemies, which I guess doesn't matter much if you can avoid being hit. Some enemies have tricky to dodge attacks, but they aren't big deal either (compared to Darksiders 2 enemies, some of them have really painful attacks and they are hard to dodge too). Oh yeah, I almost forgot: you may have problems dealing with angels, because they fly and War doesn't have good ranged weapons, but once they are on ground, they aren't a big deal.",1,0
5907712,50620,Darksiders,"This game is interesting. While not boasting of one best combat systems, it’s serviceable and easy to master, delivering around 15hr of fun. Now what this game does right is the setting and the start. I know that’s not the only game that gives you a taste of your character at full power at the start, but the way it takes those powers away slowly, and then you have to get them back as the game goes on, is well made an integral to the setting.

5927555,517710,Redout: Enhanced Edition,"TLDR: Full game that feels like early access. Even when driving well enough to consistantly earn golds, it just felt bad. Sorry, but your AG racer is in another castle.  (edited: now with even more opinions!) I'm familiar with and have loved the AG racing genre ever since Pod Racer (of which the Sulha AG seems to be an obvious reference). I had very high hopes for this game when I stumbled upon the store page prior to release. The trailer lead me to believe this to be a beautiful and well polished game, but in fact, it feels like early access to me. The sad truth is it just doesn't feel or look half as good as the games it compares itself to. Maybe a lot of design choices were to make sure it performed well in VR, I don't know, but regardless I'll just keep waiting for someone else to come along and do it better. Heck, if there's a Redout 2, I'll be sure to check it out.  So here's why I'm returning this game: -Very bare bones experience with no story, cinematics, or track intros. (What bugs me here is that you have no chance to appreciate the scenery. Good luck looking around while driving!) -No tutorial to get you used to how you are supposed to take sharp dips/climbs/turns. (yes I too hate tutorials, but it'd be nice to get just even the briefest demonstration of the unique controls and mechanics here, just so I'm not wondering whether I'm missing something) -Missing sound effects?! Collisions and explosions seem to make little or no sound. Maybe that's a bug or something, but it sure feels odd when you explode and all you hear is the music and the other racers whizzing past your scattered debris. -Sharp turns always feel terrible. part of this is the frequently transparent walls, part of this is that drifting doesn't seem to be a thing here (though you can strafe while turning, which is kind of sort of the same thing?), so even the AI frequently bops a wall here and there on sharp turns, and scrapes on sharp climbs. Again, not sure if it's supposed to be this way or not, as there are no tutorials. (Maybe this is my choice of racer? I looked up some discussions on how to take sharp turns, and I wasn't taking them the way people generally recommended, but I still managed to consistantly take 1st place soooo...?) -Just general laziness in presentation. The way the low-poly medal drops down into view at the end of a race? Are you kidding me with this? Not just unsatisfying, but downright ugly. -Assuming I'm not missing something, I burned through half of career mode in my short time with the game, getting gold on each event. Career mode may be a touch of a cakewalk for veterans of the genre.  At the end of the day, this game advertised itself as a better racer than I'd ever played before, but ended up looking and playing like one of the worst. (don't get me wrong, the tracks were indeed pretty, though lifeless. It's nearly everything else other than the pretty tracks that I dislike)",-1,0

The narative is great, not in a lyrical sense, more in the way it's really interacting with you and pulling you into this mad world.

5930721,520990,Barrow Hill: The Dark Path,"To begin: I want to reccomend this game, I really REALLY do. I cannot, in good conscience, do that. PLEASE go play Barrow Hill: Curse of the Ancient Circle instead. It's 10 years older, sure, but is a hugely better game. (It's done, for one thing.)  I am deeply and personally disappointed in Dark Path as a sequel to Barrow Hill: Curse of the Ancient Circle, which was the game that got me into point-click adventures and games in general. I ADORE Barrow Hill-- I recieved it for Christmas back in 2006-- and it shaped so much of my love for gaming. It's been released on Steam now, so it's much easier to come by.  As for Dark Path itself, I guess I'm mostly bitter. I got it the day after release, and have waded through bugs and broken code for a week. Half a dozen re-starts, and being screwed over by unwarned sequence breaking AFTER the v1.01 update really took out most of my generosity for the flaws of this one. It's not as well-populated as its predecessor, uses poorly rendered and shaded digital character models in photos (as opposed to the real-life people you see in the previous game and even in this one), and beats the last game's excellent use of Celtic-flavored lore with the Wicca stick. The area to explore is so much smaller, there's almost nothing to interact with outside of puzzles, much of the voice acting is just poor, and it completely lacks the atmosphere and tension of Barrow Hill: Curse of the Ancient Circle.  As its own game, once the sequence bugs are fixed and we have an actual final product, it could be quite good. But, as a sequel to my favorite point-click horror game: Dismally disappointing. And that's the worst part.  I'm holding out hope for Bracken Tor-- the sequel we were promised, and hopefully the one we deserve-- but I'm legitimately hurt that this was what we were given instead.",-1,0

It has a catchy soundtrack, the guns feel great to shoot, and it definitely has that Wolf 3D feel in general. However, there's one thing that really brings this game down a peg: The visuals. Yes, the visuals look nice in the screenshots, having a ZX Spectrum vibe to them, but when you're playing the game, they're dreadful. They make a lot of the areas that you need to go to hard to see and sometimes, there's so much black that I have to slow down just to aim at the direction I need to go to get out of the area.  If perhaps the walls were colored differently to make them pop out more, it would have made this game a pass for me. However, I can't do it.

5932827,524600,Dark Parables: Curse of Briar Rose Collector's Edition,"I bought this Game just recently in the Steam Winter Sales as I have been waiting for ages for this Game to go on Sale and I must say I dont regret it.  Dark Parables: Curse of Briar Rose Collector's Edition comes with the Main Story which is around 3 and a half hours long and a Bonus Chapter which gives you another half to an hour. It also comes with Extras, such as Wallpapers, Music, Mini Games and Concept Art. For the first time in a Point &amp; Click / HO Game I actually saw that there was a bit a backstory to read within the Game.   This is the First dark Parables Game in the Parables Series and I must say although the resolution was unchangeable and there was no Steam Overlay, I did really enjoy it.  It reminded me a bit of  Midnight Mysteries  just with a far less Grimm Art Style. The Voice Acting was surprisingly good compared to other HO / Point &amp; Click Games and the atmosphere was gorgeous!   It seems that this game just like Midnight Mysteries actually do depend on playing them inline unlike Grimm Legends where you can just play them backwards Numbered if you so wanted to.  Similiar to Midnight Mysteries this Game also comes with a Strategy Guide that helps you via Pictures and writing to find your way if you lost it or help you on Puzzles if you get stuck on them. Which is to me personally a huge plus so I dont need to alt+tab out and search for half an hour on the web.  The Hidden Objects were very well hidden and sometimes difficult to spot especially to its low native resolution. However once you get used to it, you should be able to find your way around just fine.  All in all this Game is a great &amp; Atmospheric Point &amp; Click / HO Game that I can recommend to anybody that loves a good story or those Kind of Games. However due to the fact that this Game is rather short with hardly any Options in the Settings Menu I recommend getting it on Sale as its base price seems a bit to high.",1,0
5932835,524660,RutonyChat,"Unpolished product here. Settings are not intuinive at all. You can't customize many of things that should be customizible like fonts, opacity etc for chat messages. Filter system is poor and allows only to ban nicknames. If you make some changes, like time display message, it restarts the whole app sending 'service connected' for each one into the browser on stream. No dailymotion. Link copying isn't obvious. It hides messages in the main window and if you set '0', which should be 'stay forever', it just hides them instantly. Genius! I believe I'll keep using restream chat for now since it has all desired features...  Devs should make a huge reworking of GUI and make it usable. Also, add english documentations WITHOUT videos. I want to make 'ctrl+f' and instantly get to the point I'm interested in.  They also charge you for additional functionality, so f-u.",-1,1

5933201,524970,Helmet Heroes,"If you're not going to take pride in your work just dont bother.   This feels like something some middle schooler made for his first flash class project. Just about every tile has a 1 pixel wide boarder from where the tiles overlap with eachother so everywhere you look there are these odd vertical lines. The controls have no cohesion, you move with WSAD and pickup items with E, even money does not auto loot so you are constantly shifting between D or A and E to pick up the shower of money with each kill.  Its simply a poorly made flash game that should be on itch.io or something. Not steam and not with microtransations.  ",-1,1

5944151,537180,Digimon Masters Online,"I wish there was a way to write a cautionary review because while I enjoy it, it is very flawed.  I'm recommending it primarilly for nostalgia reasons. If you were a fan of the show or the other games that have been released, you'll find this game enjoyable. However, I can't promise the nostalgic charm will keep you hooked. I played it for a couple days and while I'm sure I'll keep playing for a little while, I don't see myself investing a whole lot of time and money into it. Its quite a grindy game, and while the idea of paying in order to get digimon you want is appealing, its also one of the reason why I don't reccomend it. There are plenty other reasons why I wouldn't recommend it, but I want to keep this quick.  tl;dr If you like Digimon, you'll definitely feel the nostalgia with this game. Pay2Win is strong here.

There are mods for L4D that make it realistic, to the modders it's 'we are fixing' to gamers they are breaking it.  Well my point is, the charm of L4D is that it knows it's a game and plays like a game. Gives a very good one hour experience of fast pace, zombie action/survival. Players play 4 new survivors, and are required to stick together through various campaigns made up of 3-4 maps.

5991936,550,Left 4 Dead 2,"This game is one of the best zombie apocalypse games i've ever played, and it is no doubt that it is popular. Albeit the positive aspect of this game, the negative part of this game might probably outweigh the positives, and that is, needless to say, the toxic community L4D has. This world's gaming community has toxic players who behaves childishly and simultaneously behave like a spoilt brat. And this is definitely what you might be dealing one day if you were to buy this game. Trolls going around in expert games and killing everyone, then leaving the game is not uncommon in L4D. Friends playing with each other shooting strangers when the game is about to end is also common. But not all players behave like this tho, most play the game decently. Be warned, if you are the type of person who cannot stand immature behaviour, i recommend you to buy this game and play with your friends only. If not, just deal with the childish people and kick them if possible. Childish people gonna be childish people forever and never grow up.",1,0

I find it as one of those games you can only barely play. Only Just captured my intelligence through many previews and lead-ups to the game. Multiplayer on the other hand does deserve a little ,if any, praise for its constructive potential and the use of in-game credits to buy power-ups, vehicles, ammo, etc. It is a fun game for the first few hours, then becomes boring quickly, Hardly worth anything over $30. I made a mistake, I paid the full price of the game and didn't wait for the game to be on sale.  Unfortuantly, my PC didn't run the game at max settings.

The whole sordid affair took me less than six hours to beat, the lore was so deep that a sizable number of the references they dropped in-game made no sense, and the ending left me with the same bad taste in my mouth as Halo 2 and Half Life 2 - huge amounts of build-up to a supremely disappointing let-down.  The gameplay was solid and chopping down swarms of Orks was satisfying to the Nth degree, but they make the classic blunder of introducing a new bad guy 3/4 of the way through the game. I haven't tried the multiplayer, and frankly don't intend to. If I wanted a game that had to surive on its multiplayer content, I would have bought Modern Borefare 12 or something like that.

6016213,56400,"Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II - Retribution","The missions seemed bland and formulaic - Drop in, go somewhere, shoot things along the way, fight a boss once you reach the end. Occasionally this is broken up by the mission prodding you along (the infamous BEHNBLADE), or having to deal with fortified strongpoints.  The gameplay itself actually seemed weaker than the previous DoW II titles - While it's still a very unit-centric squad-based RTT, there's a lot more units available to you and on the field in general, each with their own properties. Normally I wouldn't complain about having a lot to keep track of, but micro-heavy gameplay like slotting your infantry into good cover and placing/orienting heavy weapons squads works best when you're dealing with smaller forces rather than larger ones. This is especially amplified by the general trend towards smaller engagements; Fairly frequently, I'd be cramming 40 guardsmen into a space meant for a dozen Space Marines.  Basic encounters tended to feel chaotic, but not urgent - Lots to keep track of, but not a whole lot on the line.  Boss fights rapidly became repetitive. The nature of them, one at the end of every level, plus the limited unit selection brought about by 40k armies meant that, fairly often, I'd be fighting yet *another* Hive Tyrant, except this time in a jungle-themed arena rather than a gothic cathedral-themed one.  Honestly, I think Chaos Rising is a lot stronger than Retribution, simply because it's closer to the overall design of the series. Retribution has a lot more units on the field to play around with, but Dawn of War 2 isn't a game that's designed for that and it shows.  ",-1,0

6028407,570,Dota 2,"I have 3000 hours on record. I would not recommend this game to anyone. The game has been in development for 3 years and there is a forum giving bugs and issues that players have. Some of the bugs are still unfixed after 1 year, clearly when they are patching, its just to generate more money. They are not patching to increase playability (eg. You cannot play on a resolution higher than 1920X1080 as this is considered cheating, even though you could have players with 800X640)  Do not, I mean do not even install and try this game. Its that game that you will love and hate at the same time. Then when you keep on loosing game after game after game due to their really really BAD match making system where you will play as a bronze player pitted against Diamond players.(This is no fun what so ever!)",-1,0
6029600,570,Dota 2,"I am Gonna Keep This Review Shot and Simple  Dota 2...Best Game I have ever Played.. When i Got Introduced to this game i had to abandon all other games,Dota takes you to an hole other level i dont play a lot of multiplayer games but damn this is the best multiplayer game so far,and the best part of this is dota 2 is it dsnt end here,it keeps on evolving from time to time adding new features,fixing bugs and what not  The graphics of this dota 2 is great,awesome music when in and out of battle,Dota 2 keep u at the edge of your seat, The gameplay of this game is too good one wrong decision and the game could go around, Team communication is crucial ,One team mate screws up and its game over,  Overall if i have to rate this i would give it a 9/10 cause of one reason as now leveling up is pointless and dsnt matter and no often item drops which is sad but it shldnt matter much,I would Recommend This game and believe me once u start playing you are never going to stop!!",1,0

6064554,570,Dota 2,"When I first got this game, I was very disappointed when I discovered that there is only 1 map. After that discovery, I thought that I would get bored of the game shortly. Clearly, I was wrong. I kept playing the game because I find it very entertaining and I love being competitive. DotA 2 is very addicting and a very polished game. There are only a couple of downsides with the game. The first, and most major downside, is the community. Most times, especially in lower mmr brackets and when you just start the game, people are constantly flaming each other, even their own team. It’s ridiculous, there are so many stupid hypocrites who don’t even know what they’re talking about and it can drive you nuts. A second issue with DotA, as mentioned before, is that there is only 1 map. It would be nice to have some extra free map landscapes that don’t require mods and what not. Lately, DotA 2 has made a great improvement with DotA 2 reborn, bringing in custom games built into the game to add extra variety. This is great. Overall DotA 2 is a great game that doesn’t seem like it can ever get boring because you can always improve and compete. I highly recommend it. 9.5/10.",1,0

Please, donť pay any atention to these people who say patch 7.00 (most recent gameplay patch) ruined the game, its just NOT true. They are just ignorat players, with some mental issues. And they can´t deal with changes. The thing is, game really drastically changed and nobody really know what is the best playstyle now, give it a month and it will be back to normal. I personally think, after few minor gameplay changes to balance the new stuff, game will become even better and more dynamic.   IN SHORT - what I am trying to say.

They even have a bot mode where your team is filled with actually players pit againt bots to better your teamwork in the battlefield. This game can be frustrating at times especially with rude players who treat this game as their life and with try to upset you although there is a system of reporting players for communication abuse or intentional feeding.

6101999,57640,Broken Sword 1 - Shadow of the Templars: Director's Cut,"Broken Sword is a Point and Click adventure game, one of the first 'modern' ones to hit the PC scene back in the 90s. At the time it was hailed as a fantastic game, and even now nearly 15/20 years on, I'd still consider it a game that's worth playing for the experience.   The art work still holds up, where as the animation is basic, and the voice acting has been poorly recorded, but I can forgive that. The voice acting itself is outrageous with some of the most over the top accents you'll ever here - Geordie accent included!  Some of the puzzles are still genuine headscratchers, but the good type - Mav, Priit and Saj attempted to help. Attempted.   The game felt a little long winded by the end, so I'd be interested to know which new scenes were added to the Director's Cut (as I'm not entirely sure they were needed). However, overall I'd recommend this to any PnC fans, but perhaps wait for the Trilogy in the sale if you're a curious bystander.",1,0

I never played it back upon its first release, so I came at this from a fresh perspective. I thought the game was very poor compared to other classic adventure games for the reasons I stated above. But everyone's tastes are different. I have played other older adventure games in recent years that I also never played before and I really enjoyed them, so this isn't a case of not liking it because it's old or something.

It's a casual hand holding with checkpoint only saving, limited weapons slots, the Duke has asthma and can only run about 20 feet before tireing and the jokes aren't funny to a drunk.

6116405,6020,STAR WARS™ Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy™,"Have you ever wanted to be a Jedi? The Force isn’t strong enough in real life for you to be one? Well then, this game is good enough to satisfy that need. If you never wanted to be one, then this game will show you its charm anyway and afterward, you’ll fall in the former category. Despite its outdated look, the gameplay is engaging and the story has the SW charm to it. This game has the original trilogy’s atmosphere, but it has more action. Despite its predecessor, the level design won’t get you lost and there is less linearity, as you can select your gender, race, lightsaber fighting style and its shape and choice you make in the (near)end, whether to stay in the light or give into the dark and the consequences feel strongly(the protagonists attitude changes, some die, some get hurt, everything is awesome). There are some great moments for a Star Wars fan, such as fighting alongside Chewbacca, force choking Boba Fett, or taking a station down with Wedge Antilles.   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=388457539  The gameplay involves lightsaber fighting(this is what made the Jedi Knight series famous) that inspired the combat of Blade Symphony, as there are many duels. Aside from those instances, chopping arms and heads of stormtroopers that actually can aim is really entertaining. Jumping on walls, then on your adversaries is a good example of how fluid the combat can be. There are three types of force powers: light sided ones, which involve sustaining health by healing and protection, and turning your enemies into allies, the universal ones like force push, pull, speed, sense and lightsaber throw and there are the dark sided ones, which are damaging and risky, as you’ll enter modes that strengthen you while draining your health, exposing yourself with force choke or force lightning, though the latter, when upgraded to its zenith, means pushing everyone out of the room while having bolts all over them. You also have an arsenal of weapons to your disposal, that have primary and secondary types of firing.   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=392988676  The story has its charm, as you start up as a student and end up being a Jedi Knight, there are many iconic characters and there is Kyle Katarn, the hero of the other Jedi Knight games. The plot isn’t really intriguing, but it has its mystery. 80% of the game you’ll be doing missions that don’t seem to be related to the plot, but more to being a Jedi, that is keeping the peace in the Galaxy.   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=405760786  The game last for about 8 hours, provided you tend to be alive most of the time. For Star Wars fans it’s a treat and some don’t exaggerate when they call it the best Star Wars game; while it’s a matter of taste, this game ends up on being on the favorites list. For newcomers, it’s enough to make them understand why people go crazy over Star Wars. The game isn’t complex, but is good enough to spend time with it and enjoy doing so. ",1,1

Take this really Early Impression, after roughly half an hour gameplay, with a HUGE grain of salt, since it comes from somone that wasn't really pinin for this game.   Shank, not a bad idea, looks really intersting.  But Shanks has a big problem. There seems to be a ever so tiiiiny gap between you making the input and the action following it on screen. Partly that resultet for me in attcks going into the wrong direction, other times it seems as if the game at times locks you into moves and that you can't cancel out of them ie. evade attacks, opening you up for enemy hits.  The controls are not really tight enough, and for a brawler that is a huuuge minus. Especially with so many other games nowadays beeing really good at this.   WOULD I RECOMMEND THIS?  Nope, sorry.

I just blew $60 bucks on fallout 4 and haven't had near the fun in that game as I have had in this one.... granted these two games are nothing alike.   Your goal is to basically complete all these tests that this super computer has laid out for you. She is bitter that you tried to kill her previously (maybe in portal...dont know havent played it yet) and she wants you to die, basically. I loved the wittiness and the way she taunts you throughout the game. It really makes you want to overheat her core! You are given a portal gun that enters/exits and left to decide what to do to reach the exits in each board. Seems simple enough but might find yourself scratching your head like I did a few times. Took about 5 days to beat this game, playing for several hours in the evenings and a full day. Roughly 20 some hours.  Graphics are great for a game several years old and the gameplay was smooth.

6203524,65980,Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth,"It all comes down to one question: Is the game fun?

I've put in over 300 hours in Civ 5, and I was very excited for this game at launch. I played several games when it launched, but never had any fun. I've come back to it every few months to start games, but I simply didn't have enough fun to go beyond turn 160 or so. It's been enough time that I decided to try it again. . . And it still isn't fun for the reasons listed above. Although the DLC looks great, and yes I've watched several people play the media demos, it makes me feel betrayed. I spent a time and money on this game, and what should have been a major patch seems to be going into the DLC instead.  I hope the DLC makes the game fun.

6203687,65980,Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth,"Civ:BE is a very similar experience to Civ 5, adding very little to better the series and missing many opportunities. I don't think the game is terrible, but it's definitely sub-par in my opinion. The base game is good, but the current content is underwhelming and bland. I will briefly go over all of the new features and changes to the game that improved the experience, and those that hampered it.  The Good -------------- [Web Tech Tree] Giving players more freedom in their technology choices creates for a much more open experience. The 'late game' technologies are just a few nodes away if a player chooses to go straight (usually not a good idea though). Civ V's linear tech tree was ok, but your options were severely limited and you often ended up with a similiar path each game.  [Espionage] Spying is actually interesting now. Whereas in Civ 5 the espionage system was just a fire and forget kind of system, the new spy system feels much more involved, allowing you to have a lot more control over what you do - from siphoning energy (money) from the enemy capitol or potential overthrowing the city and claiming it for your own. Yes, you can steal cities. I've done so in the past by rushing the technology with the Russian's free tech bonus and it is hilarious.  [Satellites] Not a real complex system, just a nice little addition to the game. Basically you place a stationary unit that affect a grid of tiles under it for X amount of turns.  [Expeditions] Right away your Explorer unit can dig up artifacts from satellites and other things much like an archaeologist from Civ V. This adds a neat extra thing to do early game.  The Bad  -------------- [Technological Progression] The tech tree might have improved its layout, but as a player I felt very detached from the world. I don't even know what I'm researching 90% of the time. What the hell is Alien Ethics? What kind of upgrades can I expect from something like Field Theory or Transcendental Math? Why do I need to research Physics and Engineering? I mean it's so far in the future, shouldn't I already have a really good grasp over those? As I get more and more research, I don't feel any progression. In Civ V it was VERY obvious, as your people went from cavemen to a more civilized and culture people ... but in Beyond Earth it feels so cold and lifeless, nothing I do has any real visual impact on my faction.  [Quests/Decisions] A new system which allows you to make small decisions throughout the game. Do you want +1 Food, or +1 Energy? +5 unit healing or +1 Science and Energy? As well as things like 'Be nice to the bugs, or eradicate them (affects affinities)'. These are soon forgotten and very inconsequential. By the time you reach the end of the game, you'll have more or less forgotten about your choices as they have such an incredibly low impact on the game. This system is good conceptually but was executed in a very boring way.  [Wonders] Unexciting and bland. Even the 'you completed the wonder' message is lame, unlike Civ V where it felt like a huge accomplishment, wonders in BE are just a major let down. There also seems to be a serious lack of variety with them, but maybe that's just me.  [Factions] Not only are the wonders boring in this game, so are the leaders, factions, the sponsors, the affinities. Every aspect of customization is boring as hell. The only thing that separates each faction is a single bonus and a color scheme. All of the choices you make when you start the game (and there aren't many choices, to be honest) are unexciting. Do you want to start with a worker, or a soldier, or maybe you want pioneering for free? Civ 5 offered a couple of unique units/buildings/tile improvements and a few unique abilities that would really set each race apart - but everything feels so samey now. I often forget what faction I picked in Civ BE... that was never the case in Civ 5, where I was constantly reminded of what civilization I chose.  [Religion] No religion? They could have at least added something in its place, like politics or some kind of alien cult-worshiping stuff. Religion was one of my favorite aspects of Civ V and BE feels like it's missing a huge chunk of variety because it's gone.  [City States] Their new version of city states are just a building that you can do a trade route with. Basically the same thing except they don't offer quests.   [Affinities] You level them up linearly from 0 to 13, you occasionally pick some unit upgrades, and there's a few bonuses like 'Aliens won't attack your Explorer' and 'Units take less damage from miasma.' The unique units even feel pretty similar across all 3 affinities. I was really hoping there'd be like an additional social-policy/tech-tree thing to choose how to customize how the affinities affect my faction, but that's not the case. The Affinities don't add much to the experience.  [World Variety] This is one of the most lack-luster elements of the game. There's virtually NO variety for planets in this game. I've played most of the way through 5 games so far and started about a dozen different new maps and I must say every planet looks really similar. I was hoping for some crazy randomization, both visually and mechanically, but instead I got a bunch of boring Earth-like planets. Where's the color? I want some planets with bright, deep color palettes. I want to see worlds with extreme weather like lightning and sandstorms, planets with no oxygen, more variety for wild life. Why is every indigenous alien bug species exactly the same for all worlds? I guess every single planet other than earth is inhabited by a race of mostly-passive gigantic green bugs.  [Neutral Aliens] They do nothing, usually. Even if I attack them every turn for a long time they don't get mad at me (I've played on both Apollo (8) and Gemini (6) difficulty so far). Then there's the siege worm which is just a minor nuisance that is unkillable until much later into the game, kind of like a natural disaster. I don't think it adds anything to my experience, it's just stupid. There's also ZERO variety in aliens, as I've mentioned above in world variety. Everything is a stereotypical 'bug race'.  [Computer's AI] The AI is completely brain-dead. Even on Apollo difficulty, which apparently just makes them cheat, the AI does nothing to thwart my efforts. With just a small army of infantry/rangers/artillery supported by a couple of mid-game units I can wipe out all of the AI with ease. They will ask me 'please I beg of you, give me this resource things aren't going so well', and when I try to accept they angrily decline and say 'I MUST ASK FOR MORE'. That's like I asked you for a cookie, and when you tried to say 'Sure' I was insulted that you were offering me only a cookie and not milk also. The only way to make Civ:BE a challenging single player experience is to give yourself a major disadvantage by modding the game or purposely stacking the odds against you.  [Micro-Management] Automation AI is still terrible. It will constantly make bad decisions when prioritizing tiles, so you gotta manually pick each tile yourself if you wanna be effective. What's worse is that the game stops notifying you about a new citizen after the 5th one per city. Why is there no option to turn that back on? Also they've done nothing to add more depth to the game since Civ 5. It's the same old 'allocate citizens to tiles, choose production' route. I was really hoping they'd get more creative with what you can do but maybe they were worried it would confuse new players?  The Ugly -------------- The game will rely on DLC to feel complete.  Since I know the game will be another DLC/Expansion-pack circle-jerk, I cannot with a good conscience recommend this game to anyone but hardcore Civ-Fans. I don't think I wasted my money, but I am definitely disappointed. I'll probably continue to play the game until I'm sick of it, but I just wish they did a better job.  Rating: C",-1,1

6206258,65980,Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth,"Civ: Beyond Earth gets a 6/10 from me. Disappointing enough I'm not even finishing my first game (just mop-up of weaker civs left). It's like a worse version of Civ5. The thing that brutally drags the entire game down with it is how poorly implemented the technology web is - it's extremely time consuming, frustrating, and difficult to formulate any kind of planned progression. Some tech will require you to have upgrades on specific resources, which requires a completely different part of the web, which is never explained, so you have to try to memorize the entire thing. Poor iconography hinders this as well. Victory conditions are also heavily obscured, which is mind-boggling. Trying to figure out the non-military victory path was really hard. The quests and artifacts are great additions, and I loved the give/take relationship there, and they added some unpredictability. The aliens are basically passive barbarians, and although the game kept threatening they've got a hive-mind that'd get angry, I slaughtered them with utter impunity for ~200 turns with no impact",-1,0

6206563,65980,Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth,"You know, I really wanted to like this game. Civ is what got me into gaming, and the idea of a redone alpha centauri had a lot of appeal. However, it suffers hugely from two things. First, Firaxis' DLC strategy, wherein they release a game that's mostly there, then introduce new core mechanics and major improvements in high-price DLCs afterwards. Second, there have been a lot of 4X competitors in recent years, and they've really shown up how poor the Civ series has become.  While Rising Tide fixes various issues, it makes others worse. Diplomacy is notionally more sophisticated, but very easy to farm. The factions don't really feel different, and the technologies are just confusing. In particular, the world doesn't draw you in, even with the new additions - they're basically controllable barbarians. Thjere's very little of the replay appeal that's given by Civ's history, or other game's meaningful differences between factional playthroughs.  Buy Endless Space instead, or Galactic Civilizations.",-1,0
6206626,65980,Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth,"I Beyond Earth has a lot more potential than Civ V - just because the setting allows for more content. Unfortunately it is much more dependent on mods to keep it interesting and replayable at the moment, a lot more so than Civ V anyhow.  The affinity system is basically an ideology makeover, with a preset order of bonuses, but I prefer it to Ideologies to be honest.  The science web allows for a lot more flexibility in what you focus on tech-wise, yet a lot more likely to forget a more vital tech, as it can be hard to see what is what in the web.  The two things I like most about Beyond Earth the most are the alien lifeforms, and the amount of customisation available to you before you even launch the game. Aliens are the replacement for barbarians, but are neutral to your military units until provoked, or you stray too close to their nest.   I am not recommending Civ Beyond Earth at this present time based on its full asking price, but at 50% off it would be worth considering.",-1,0

6208832,65980,Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth,"Beyond Earth is a good example of what's wrong with modern game development.  These days you buy a 'core game' for full retail price and then pay more for DLC to add on all the things that would have been incorporated into the retail version of the game in the old days. The higher prices wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for multiplayer. Multiplayer game mechanics and single player game mechanics are utterly different, particularly for strategy games, and since MP is where the money is you end up with single player experience getting shorted. Beyond Earth doesn't have even half of the personality of Alpha Centauri because why would they bother with depth and richness when you're expected to play against other people? As an integral game component other people suck. They're belligerent and foul mouthed, they cheat and drop connection if things don't go their way, and that's what modern games make their core mechanic.

So do not buy this until they are done patching it, and pick up the entire pack of DLC for the cost of the original game (or less). But only if reviews are confirming that they put the gameplay back into the game, and reversing the lobotimization ('accessibility' in DevSpeak).

I wasn't disappointed, but I wasn't excited either, until I noticed that Beyond Earth is actually a game of subtle nuance. I do 'recommend' it with a caveat: At the current price of 50-60 dollars, I would not recommend it, ... I recommend that you wait until the price comes down a bit and more mods become available through the modding community.  The game can be easily modified to your liking and/or playing style. Check out the Steam Workshop for all the latest Mods for Beyond Earth. The Workshop makes it very easy to install the various mods available for Beyond Earth simply by 'subscribing' to them and ticking off which mods you want to use from the main game menu.  For more in-depth discussions about Strategy and Tips for Beyond Earth, go to the CivFanatics forums here:  http://forums.civfanatics.com/forumdisplay.php?f=501   Civilization: Beyond Earth is very slick and polished in appearance, and is full of wonderful art and graphics, yet, in the beginning, the gameplay feels like Civilization 5 on an alien world, with the addition of 'Affinities', 'Virtues' and Orbital Satellites and other features altering the game mechanics.  At face value, Civilization: Beyond Earth appears to be an elaborate full conversion type of Mod put together by a skilled game modification team, only this team got paid for their work. It is most definitely NOT a successor to Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri or Alien Crossfire. It does have a reference to the Progenitors through some rare ruins found on the planet, and the Contact Victory, but that is the extent of any similarity to the earlier games.   What many may have missed though, is that Beyond Earth has a lot of subtle elements and nuances at play within the game. This is why I think it deserves a second look.  The Wonders are presented in an 'understated' way, that is, there are no flashy 'Wonder Movies', only a brief dialogue about the Wonder and it's effects. Personally, I could care less about the absence of this type of eye candy and tend to focus more the actual benefits each Wonder bestows upon my chosen faction.  In the very beginning of the game, during set up, you are asked which planet type in which star system you are colonizing. Real star system names and planetary types are used for flavor. I tend to prefer Huge maps with Epic or Marathon game lengths. It is through these choices that enabled me to discover what others  may  have overlooked in Standard or smaller map sizes with shorter and faster game lengths.   Affinities ;  H armony,  P urity, and  S upremacy.  Each one forms the basis of each factions ideology and determines the combat unit types the factions will use and their upgrade progression. You can choose to focus on only one Affinity or a combination of Affinities, which in turn will unlock more combat unit types. Affinity levels also grant bonus enhancements for your chosen faction in the areas of Industry, Food, Energy, and/or Culture.   Virtues ,  M ight,  P rosperity,  K nowledge, and  I ndustry.  At first glance, it appears to have a similar structure to what you find in Civilization V, but it works in a very different way. All of the Virtues are unlocked from turn 0, and you are best advised to  not  progress through them in a linear fashion, ie; fill out the Might Virtue, then the Prosperity, and so on. The best way to progress through the Virtues is using a combination of all 4 with a goal of completing the 'Synergy' bonuses along the X and Y axis of the Virtues grid.    Technology Web  The Technology 'Tree' has been replaced with a 'Web' which takes some getting used to, ... okay, change is not always bad.   At first glance, it appears to have no clear direction to follow and no linear progression. If you do not have a clear idea how to aproach the Web, be assured, the  AI  does and will leave you in the dust if you don't understand how it works with the Affinities and Virtues. Pick an Affinity to follow first and use that to guide you through the Technology Web, ... then it begins to make sense.    Beyond Earth Factions   I agree with many of the comments here. They do appear shallow and lifeless, ... at first. Their drawback and what makes them appear so lifeless, in my opinion, is their sparse voice dialogue and constant begging for your strategic resources in exchange for apparently useless 'favors' (what the ??). Yet they are not entirely stupid either. (see the discussion here:  http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=544346  )   Affinities affect Diplomatic relations.   This effect is a no-brainer. A faction that is all chummy with you in the beginning, can become not so friendly later in the game due to their chosen Affinity development path. This is why there are factions. Each Leader thinks they know best about how to colonize an alien world.   The Harmony Affinity views the Alien Lifeforms as something to be understood and preserved, If you seek to destroy the Alien Lifeforms, a faction that has chosen Harmony will become hostile toward you.   Promises kept and promises broken.   If you make a 'promise' like not settling cities near a faction, or attacking the Alien lifeforms, and break that 'promise', they will remember it. Conversely, if you make a 'promise' and keep that 'promise' for a certain number of turns, they will remember that too. Promises have a Diplomatic effect.   Favors  are not as useless as they might appear to be at first. If you have gained some favors with a faction, you can extract promises from them in turn, and generally, they will keep them. Promises such as  'cease and desist spy activity against me' , or  'do not settle any cities near mine' , etc., can be useful. Go to war against that faction and any 'favors' you may have had with them are gone.  Believe it or not, unlike the Barbarians in Civilization games, the Alien Lifeforms can be made into 'allies', ... of a sort. You can gain the ability to become immune to the pervasive 'maisma' and 'befriend' the alien life to the point that they will not attack your cities and instead attack the factions that have followed Affinities and practices detrimental to them.    Bugs are your Friends, ...sometimes.  It is not a blatant alliance, yet it is a subtle and somewhat helpful 'understanding' with the alien life on the planet and they will, in certain circumstances, attack whichever faction is attacking you.   Satellites  Another feature is the ability to launch satellites, all kinds of satellites. At first glance, this feature may seem somewhat weak and boring, until you go to war with another faction. Then Orbital Laser platforms, TacNet, and Phasal Transporter satellites can turn the tide in confilcts.   Quests?  Quests is another marginally interesting feature. Most often thay are minor quests given after constructing a certain building type, thereby creating a 'decision point' for the player:  'Which bonus do you want to assign to this building type?'  There are a few major quests that follow a short story and contain multiple 'decision points' for the player to follow.

6213033,65980,Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth,"I will start by saying I am a huge fan of the Civ series. I have played since Civ III and loved every game that has come out. That is until this one.   Pros: - This is a Civ V mod and looks really good - They tried a lot of new ideas and concepts with this game  Cons: - Your first playthough you tend to just fumble through the game. No real information or direction given until you research something, or come across something.  - Miasma is a pain! Is a bit difficult to see, and it slows the game down A LOT. I don't fully understand its purpose or function in the game unless it is there to slow things down.  - The Tech Web is not difficult to understand, but overall a chaotic mess. Some work on this is sorely needed.  - Some of the control and visual icons could use some work. Civ V you knew what button you were pressing, or what unit had what veteran abilities. In this game not so much.  - Affinity needs a lot of work. I understand that you go down one of three paths and that each one requires X resource. It is just boring. I expected more from a Civ game.  - Quest Log Display needs some work. Display to the player what is needed at a glance, rather than have the player open it up and scroll down. It is annoying to have to open quest after quest to find out what I need to do. A bullet point underneath them would do wonders to making this interface more user/player friendly.  - The map seems cramped.  - The AI is not very good at all. Predictible and you can outright ignore them with seemingly zero penalty. Before this game came out they said they did work on this AI to make it better. So where is that?  - Favors for the AI players is a unique concept. Yet without any real explanation of what they do they are uselss. I don't care to take the time to find out what they do.  Just like many have said this is an unfinished game unworthy of even the $20 price tag. Hopefully with the next expansion, or more likely the second expansion, this game will be better.

The story is so bland and direct it doesn't make any sense. I'm quite impressed by size of the map, but what's good about have a big map if it's just empty and boring? Missions aren't very interesting either and feel repetitive.  Yes, I've played it for almost two hours and I'm already tired of it. Especially when the missions are half broken most of the time.  An example: you have to steal a truck with coca and bring it back to a garage. The truck may not be destroyed, but in order to keep it from blowing up you have exit it a few time kill some cartel guys and some cops and enter again. Guess what happens if you exit the truck for too long? It dissapears.... FUN  To be honest, I'm not very impressed by the graphics, even for a 2006 game. The bloom effect in this game is so strong it hurts my eyes.  In short, just skip it, it feels a like frustrating chore.

The graphics are still OK by 2015 standards and gameplay is fine and consistent with the newer Tomb Raider titles. My first gripe, as with many people are the awful controls that let you down often. Especially the final battle it is so hard getting Lara to do anything. Another gripe is the nature of some of the puzzles. A good puzzle is where you know what needs to be achieved and need to go about finding a way to get there. Some of the puzzles in Legend are not really puzzles in this way. You sometimes have no idea what you are trying to achieve and only have a few interactable elements to play with. You basically just work things together until something happens.

I understand that without them, it'd just be another WWII FPS. But I'm fine with that. We need more of those. The dinosaurs seem like they could easily throw the balance of the game way off (considering one side is nearly all dinosaurs and one is nearly all humans). The most fun I've had so far was as an Axis rifleman. The Axis are the dinosaur-heavy faction, so aside from the occasional Allied dinosaur, it felt like a standard WWII FPS.  I encourage the developers to do something (perhaps a gamemode) to allow for standard FPS gameplay. The game has a distinct 40's style. Overall, Dino D-Day is no fun.

6238768,70100,Hacker Evolution,"Hacker Evolution attempts to give you the experience of being a skilled hacker. While the game seemed like an intresting concept the actual game is rather lackluster.

This results in both repititous gameplay and difficulty, as you will be forced to remember many different inputs from the tutorial stage, without much help afterwards. The game is also difficult for newcomers, as your wanted level is transferred from mission to mission, including even the tutorial stage. If you mess up enough on one stage you will either have to redo the mission or carry your mistakes on to the next level. You are able to pay to decrease your wanted level, but there are other things, such as cpu upgrades that you will need to spend money on to even have a chance at completing a level.

I'd sooner have fun completing every tutorial in every paradox game ever made than try to do this tutorial again. It was just too boring. It taught you what felt like everything the game had to offer, and yet I still got into my first match feeling like I've learned nothing at the same time. And here's what I learned in my short time in my first match and in the tutorial of this game.  +The game takes a unique spin on the RTS genre, points for bravery. +You can raise literally a fleet as large as your CPU can support. That is astounding, and really helps the combat element in this game. +/- A very unique take on planet management, one that is complicated to understand, but also sort of interesting to toy with. Every planet forms a web of resources, and can be tailored by your or an AI to a certain task. +/- Resource collection feels lacking. everything essentially starts as ore, which then gets processed into countless more complicated resources to tailor to specific production. Ore is limited on a planet, so you need to keep expanding or also begin to take advantage of asteroid fields. I've never been a fan of 'One resource' strategies like that, especially when you then need to tailor certain planets into factories to turn that resource into a specific production part. It just seems like a needlessly complicated version of what should be something simple, and I just don't like it. -The tech tree is bad. Instead of researching specific techs, you have this strange map of generalized tech types. You can queue different ones for research, or just leave it on one type, and watch as they 'level up'. This doesn't provide you with anything new really, it just upgrades the effeciency of what you already have. To update your ship with 'new' upgraded tech you hit the 'update' button on the schematics, and then retrofit. You then watch as no visible change is made to the ship, but know deep down that somehow, it is better that it was. Even if it's completely unobservable. -Diplomacy is pointless and makes no sense. I can't have a peace treaty without an expiry date or it lasts the entire round? What the ♥♥♥♥? Ever hear of breaking a treaty? How declaring war nullifies treaties? I don't want a match-long peace or alliance I just want one that ends when I or my ally chooses to end it, not at the end of 1-10,000 seconds. Oh, and no normal human being counts time periods that long in seconds so what the ♥♥♥♥? -Ship design is utterly confusing/under-done/needing a complete redesign. Essentially you just drag and drop modules, hulls, engines, and etc onto a flat square that is supposed to be representing your ship. They tell you placement matters, if you put it towards the front, it will be in the front. If you overlap it with another module, you may get some bonuses. Why the hell is it apparently so complicated like that then, if I'm designing a ♥♥♥♥ing square? I don't know where things are going to pop out on an aerodynamic long-shaped ship when I'm designing a god damn square! I don't know what these 'bonuses' i get for overlapping things are, because nothing in the game teaches you this. This is a pathetic way to go about ship design.  I could go on ranting, but I'll end by saying that Star Ruler is a game you play only when you have NOTHING else to play, at best. I give this a 3/10. It has potential hidden in there, but I can't bring myself to waste my time trying to see if it ever shows itself. I certainly hope Star Ruler 2 is better than this.

6265812,7670,BioShock,"Actually, I dislike this game. Yeah, I'm so crazy, right? I've got about as much salt for this game as there is salt in the ocean it takes place in. ♥♥♥♥ BioShock. It's a piece-of-♥♥♥♥ game with gimmicky-as-♥♥♥♥ plot devices and simplistic gameplay that requires very little thought or effort to dominate. Not the slightest bit challenging or engaging, and with no true depth, despite the potentially interesting gimmicks that went into it. I mean, I was actually excited for this game back in the day. It really did actually have some fascinating things going for it, but turns out, I was in for a disappointment. There just isn't much to it, and it really dropped the ball on what it was marketed up to be. Somehow though, the rest of the world totally buys into this petty mediocre FPS, touting it as one of the most groundbreaking and revolutionary games in all the history of the whole video game medium, which is just sad to me. This is the M. Night Shyamalan of video games. Suck it, fanboys.  The atmosphere and worldbuilding is not bad though. To call this a succesor to System Shock, though, is just a hilariously disgusting insult. I think after the fight with the surgeon, I started to quickly lose my sense of wonder. And it has a 'clever' twist and libertarian themes, oooooh... If you really think about it, Bioshock is a game of very limited depth, which goes against everything it was supposed to be. Nothing but shallow gimmicks and unfulfilled promises of player freedom. Oh, but that's part of the irony right? That there's no player freedom? Then I guess it's ironic that it's a sucky game too. I laugh at the pitiful folks who were apparently blown away by  this . Ugh. When I think of overrated games, this is always one of the first to come to mind. It could have been cool, it  should  have been cool, but Irrational Games, rather irrationally, failed to deliver. A truly mindless, dull  irrational  game. And the worst part is, it's not even an offensively  bad  game, more like offensively second-rate, when it could have been something pretty outstanding, but it's not. Nope, I was not impressed at all. Sorry, fellas.  Oh, and the final boss fight and Little Sister morality metric suck incredible and copious amounts of giant black ballsack. Like, oh my god. For real? Are you ♥♥♥♥ing kidding me, Bioshock? R. U. SRS. What do people see in you, Bioshock? How do you explain yourself? How can you even look at yourself in the mirror, Bioshock?!   Long story short: To me, the feelings I had playing this game were a 50/50 split of 'Hmm... That's pretty cool' and 'Eh... That's pretty lame'. I thought it was going to be pretty amazing going into it, but despite having some unique, original ideas, the gameplay was undercooked and virtually the entire game, despite being set deep in the ocean, came off as shallow. It's an average-quality casual FPS, sub-par RPG, lukewarm horror, with some fairly refreshing philosophical and sci fi ideas and distinct atmosphere and worldbuilding for the genre, but people talk it up way way way waaaaay too much and give it obnoxiously more credit than it deserves. It's not even that bad of a game, it's just not that good of a game either. I know, what an outrageous thing to say.  So yeah, this game kinda sucks. Even obnoxious fanboys aside, this is still not a game I would particularly recommend to anyone. There are better first-person RPG-like games out there to choose from that are much more substantial and with more depth on a gameplay standpoint. So here I am, fighting against the white noise of constant praise for this letdown of a game. Novel concept and presentation, but it just didn't truly deliver for me, as a video game. Again, undercooked. I hope this dissent has been helpful to anyone who wants to know THE SHOCKING SHAMEFUL TRUTH ABOUT BIOSHOCK. It's not that good...",-1,0

I was also encouraged by the interesting story to look everywhere and find as many bits of story as I could. I can see the game becoming bland real fast if you didnt bother listening to the recordings or people. Pretty sure one of my favorite things was finding the recording in a room and listening to it while i took out all the baddies. Or the random rooms with a nice old timey radio as the backdrop for a massacre.  Also it still looks pretty even if it is a bit out of date. Old is not equivalent to bad.",1,0

If I were to summarize the game in a sentence, and I intend to do so, that sentence would be as follows: 'Just Cause 2 is like Far Cry 3, but if you played as Spider Man.' The grappling hook and parchute features in Just Cause 2 make the gameplay ridiculous in all the right ways. If your a fan of open world games, you have to give Just Cause 2 a spin. I also hear that Just Cause 2 is better than Just Cause 3 or the original, but that's just what I heard. I'm no expert on the Just Cause franchise, but I'm certainly a fan of this particular installment.  There are ♥♥♥♥ tons of optional quests, collectibles, and extras in the game, but the maingame is probably only 10 hours if you ignore all the extras, which makes this game open to many diffferent playstyles. Also, when I say ♥♥♥♥ tons, I do mean ♥♥♥♥ tons. I played this game for around 25 hours, but I could have played it for 50 hours, easily. There's a lot to do in this game. I also really enjoyed the variety of biomes in Just Cause 2: there's towering snowy peaks, vast desert landscapes, rolling hills, and even dense cityscapes: it's like Far Cry 3, Far Cry 4, and GTA 4 all in a single package. There's so much going on in this game, it's unlikely that you wont find your niche.  In summation, Just Cause 2 is a lot of fun with a lot to do. It's a purely entertaining experience, and for it's current price on steam, it's a hel f a buy.

(my instructions are to be at locaton. so yes game 10+ years old and tutoral is fail).   Than enemy fleet is folowing us. enemy fleet is about 5 cheapest ships in the game, so basicaly any noob with basic weapons can kill em (tuttorial enemy) and my fleet counts about 30-60 ships that dont look basic to me. than i waited. thinking oh if we need to kill those 5 ships i think my 30-60 that are realyy bigger than enemy will handle them. waiting,... i got destroyed and gg.   Still there 15 mins later. those enemy fleet still up and shooting while my fleet is shooting in blank space. what can be more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, i think i seen full game after this.  MY fleet stronger like 50 ships vs 5 totaly noob ships. my fleed is shooting at random into blank space. Maybe they forgot to put in text or audio that would sugest that allied ships shoot at random into space and i should deal with weakest enemy in the game?   maybe they either wite me that my ships will shoot into a blank space instead shoooting enemy.  or maybe they should write me that i have to shoot enemy ships before i can move into the drifter hive!   i pay for that monthly?  what can i expect? more totaly illogical stuff. like 50 ships cant deal with 5 enemys? they are still up! after 30 mins.  Best fight i ever seen its right at start in tutorial. When u try to enter hive. LOL 50 allyed ships cant deal with 5 enemy (weakest ships in the game), not couse they weak but becouse they shooting at random into space. im realy interested into space battles so i was actualy waiting in my dead state there to see how long time will it take for my 50 allyed ships to kill 5 enemy.  they didnt kill em, guess its programed so that my ships are shooting at random, while enemy came to kill only me and than returned unharmed. Most amazing battle i seen in any space game ever. cant be more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.",-1,0

6304939,8800,Sid Meier's Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword,"While this is not a universal truth, I believe that a strategy game where only on strategy can be used to win is in essence: NOT a strategy game. The reality is that in Civlization IV vanilla, defence is kind of possible, but needs a LOT of effort and is not ultimatly worth it because your score point generation falls off the map while producing military units you will not use to take a capital/city.   However, in BTS this is even worse because defence is not even possible. You must research knights to counter catapults? wtf. The research is only like 1000 years apart. The only stategy available in Civ IV is: ATTACK, ATTACK, ATTACK! If that is how I wanted to play then I would play a fricken RTS. (Real Time Strategy) Like AoM, Warcraft III, or Starcraft. The fact that this grind for military units is the only way to play makes all other parts of the game more like a dissapointing minigame you pursue while everyones LotR size hordes hump eachother in the field. If you pursue a science victory you essentially are achieving a military victory, but decided to make a spaceship while your nukes were in transit to your enemies loved ones.   So, once again I state: A strategy game with one strategy is not strategy game at all. Don't really want to be identified as a Civ V fan boy, but yes they fixed this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in Civ V and you can actually enjoy 5 different victory goals. (if you buy all the expansions that is, otherwise the vanilla game is the same meatgrinder of military units you wait on, while you fap or look at reddit) So, do not buy this game unless you want to have stacks of units slap eachother until one loses the strength to go on.   If you still want to buy this game, buy it on  {LINK REMOVED}  www.♥♥♥.com  for a $6 steam code intead of fricken $30-35 on steam, or what ever its up to now with the Civ VI announcement.

6305729,8850,BioShock 2,"Took me 3 tries to get into Bioshock 1. Turned out to be a very good game. Bioshock 2, to me, was a lot easier to get into. I held out on playing this one because it didn't have controller support, but it was recently patched in when GFWL was removed. Graphics are slghtly better than the first. They can be improved by using the NVIDIA Control Panel for better AA and AF. You can also improve the slow control responsiveness by altering the .ini file. The game also has well-know sound issues. This doesn't take away the fact that it's a lot of fun to play through. You're a big daddy, and you will need to make the same choice of rescuing or 'adopting' the little sisters. I rescue them all to get the 'good' ending :) Plasmids and tonics still a lot of fun to play with, and finding all the recordings is essential to follow the story. Rapture looks great! All in all, recommended.",1,0
6306209,8850,BioShock 2,"Bioshock 2 places the player back in the undersea world of Rapture. The game takes place several years after the events of the first game. In this game you play as Subject Delta, a Big Daddy that is trying to find his Little Sister. There is more to it, but I'd rather avoid any major spoilers.  Rapture looks better than ever in the second entry of the series. The graphics have been improved in every way. There isn't any undersea combat, but walking around at the bottom of the sea was a beautiful experience. The combat and controls have been vastly improved in every way. Although it was sad to see that the old hacking system was removed, the new one keeps you in battle and has a far more fluid feeling. The story isn't as interesting as it was in the previous game, but it is far from bad. They probably should have fleshed out the story from the Minvera's Den DLC and used it for the base game instead.  Despite all of the positive aspects of this game, I cannot recommend it. I don't know if this game is a sloppy console port, but it sure feels like one. I played this with a GTX 960 (a much better video card than the suggested 8800 GT) and I thought my computer was going to have a meltdown. The game runs so poorly that the developers should be ashamed. I spent some time reading other reviews and it doesn't seem like I'm the only person that has had this issue. I rushed through the game because I was concerned about the strain it was placing on my computer even after drastically reducing the settings. Sad, it might have been fun to play through a second time.  If it weren't for the performance issues I would recommend this one. Alas, here we are.

6306970,8850,BioShock 2,"While it is my least favorite Bioshock game (so far, since, like in the case of this particular entry, the furture of the series is no longer handled by the Irrational team), I still recommend this entry alongside the others.  I think my own personal enjoyment of narrative videogames rests in how immersive they can be, and how long it takes for me to be ejected from the illusion of their world; to 'see the set pieces and stagehands', as it were. My favorite Bioshock, Infinite, kept me in its world for the entire duration, plot issues aside. It had a fantastical world of sheer imagination, which was paired hand-in-hand with elements you'd constantly interact with which grounded it, providing that stabilizing factor to the immersion: at points, Elizabeth would ask me to help with something, and I would hop to it. I wasn't knowing that was the way forward, I was helping a friend. Booker was a 'role', a rare thing in a role-playing game these days (I know, right?). The original Bioshock was likewise mind-blowing at many points, and kind of did most of the series' best twists first: pursuing and finally confronting a nemesis full of surprises, subliminal messaging and the illusion of choice, existential crises, destiny... lots of awesome stuff there, and big game-changers; things which stirred emotion and motivation up to the surface from the muck of the routines the player gets into.  Those factors motivating my opinion in mind, this one was much less interesting to me, sadly (with the exception of Minerva's Den, which was unique in ways). The world felt less shiny, as though that rebellion and fury was gone and a corporate-built effigy stood in its way, pretending to challenge me emotionally as its predecessor had, gesturing and waving endlessly and heartlessly like a Dollar Bill vending machine. The Big Sister felt like someone's ham-fisted attempt at changing the game, but came off as stumbling: who decided that kidnappings were the best way to explain the return of the sisters/daddies? It just felt so recycled and arbitrary after Bioshock 1's conclusion! As though someone had put the pieces back in and shocked the monster back to life, but forgot the heart! The villain also was very 'same-y': another fanatic who becomes a charicature of an ideal: who could ever agree with any part of her madness? A villain needs to compel you in some way; to reach an idea you had and then EXPLODE IT! All I ever wanted was for her to shut up! 'Delta, you suck, and I'm never wrong because I'm religious', 'Delta, you are a failure who is nonetheless a nonstop ♥♥♥-kicking machine and I don't get that'... obnoxious!  Now, as an aside, I'll point out something they did right: they appealed to my fathering instinct, but it started to get weird when it got to be like a 'Mom vs Dad' situation, oddly enough: I kind of felt at times like I was a counterpoint in an argument between 'my' daughter and her mother, and it was just awkward then. Likewise, saving the damsel at the end and getting to have a powerful buddy was great, but... well, having Elizabeth always in-scene and on hand was my favorite part of Infinite... being forced to 'summon' your buddy in this game instead of walking with and working with her as a team really pulled the cool factor out of it, as well as the catharsis of finally being  with  her (screw you, mom!)! They should have had her lurk nearby, and then have you stumble into fights that were WAY out of your league, just to showcase her tearing the room apart and saving your lazy maple bacon! Would have really made things interesting, in my opinion.  Back on course, some of the stragglers in the city you deal with just seemed like they missed their chance to play with the big kids in Bioshock 1... Sinclair in particular was so desperate and felt like such a Fontaine-wannabe that I really couldn't bring myself to hate or love the chap; he was just... boring. Like, Jeremiah Fink-level uninteresting. Lastly, the plot felt peripheral in pretty much every way; nothing reached from the story and GRABBED me from the routines I'd get into! It was such a temporary reprieve to talk with someone, but it was nearly ALWAYS 'go here' and 'fetch that' or 'Hey old salt, the bathysphere's moving again! Ain't that swell?'. Snore! Nobody tricked me into going along with their plot, nobody played both sides like a pro and made me mad at people, winding me up and letting me knock them all down... nothing! All I did was chase a crazy lady who slammed doors right in my face!  Therein is the weakness of this entry. Nothing challenged my thinking, nothing grabbed my heart, nothing compelled. Contrast: in Bioshock 1's denouement involving the long-awaited face-to-face with Andrew Ryan, I was on my feet. I even applauded my screen. I was riveted (Bioshock puns!). Conversely, in my playthrough of Bioshock 2, I actually stopped halfway through because I just didn't care, and I only returned to it months later out of idle curiosity and a Bioshock hunger, wanting to see if it improved.  It was the same old, same old; better served as an expansion pack or a DLC on top of the section of Bioshock 1 where you gain some control over Big Daddy abilities, since it was almost literally just an expansion of that mechanic, in my mind.  All in all, this is, in my humble opinion, the weakest entry, but still a strong showing. If this is as weak as it gets (yet), the series was pruned too quickly... but that one's on Ken Levine. What a dramatic guy.",1,0
6309318,8850,BioShock 2,I love this game just as much as the first. I am disappointed that the errors of the texture problem at some points in the game were never fixed. Minerva's Den worked perfectly and it was great too.,1,0
6309652,8870,BioShock Infinite,"Infinite's world is mind-blowing. The graphics are excellent, the city, story, and enemies are creative, and Elizabeth is a great female character. It is incredibly fun to zip around on the cargo rails, watch different factions attack each other, fight off enemy airships, and just explore the city Irrational Games has created.  Unfortunately, Infinite is plagued with repetition. For the majority of the game, you must basically kill everything that moves, loot, get ambushed or creep up to a new area of enemies, and repeat. In addition, the gameplay itself is repetitive; while the gunplay is great, there is a seriously limited selection of guns, and while some of the magic abilities are useful, most are virtually useless. The game will also make you fight the same bosses over and over, and you will find yourself saying 'Again?' throughout. You may also find yourself becoming frustrated like I did during the graveyard scene (or other scenes), but I just turned the difficulty down to Easy and it was manageable.  Thankfully, Elizabeth proves to be an awesome companion and really changes up what would otherwise be an average game. You can tell her to create a first-aid supply station during battle, direct her to spawn a aircraft to shoot missles at enemies, and even change the world completely. If it were not for her, it would be easy to lose interest in the game, but Elizabeth and her story were what motivated me to play to the end. Although it has some flaws, exploring the city with Elizabeth is an amazing experience, and so I think Infinite is above average and is worthy of your time.  ",1,0

6323754,8870,BioShock Infinite,"The gameplay is the usual mix of conventional weapons and creative use of your Plas- excuse me, your Vigors and the environment. The skylines make it a lot easier to get around the battle stages, and the tears add even more potential for crazy chaos, although they sometimes feel like they're there just so Elizabeth has something to do. I'm not a big fan of the carry limit on guns though; like a lot of modern shooters, Bioshock Infinite allows you to only carry 2 guns with you at any time. In a game series that's all about creative combat, this feels like an odd choice (although the number of different guns in the game is huge), and fortunately the devs chose to go back to letting you carry all weapons at once for Burial At Sea.  The game is less about scavenging than the first one. You still get some freedom about the way you explore an area (and going straight for the objective will mean you miss out on a lot), but it lacks the sense of desolation that you get in Bioshock 1 and 2, simply because in those two games, you walk around in Rapture after the civil war, while Infinite takes place before/during the civil war in Columbia. It makes sense but I still miss it.  The graphics are stunning. Columbia looks absolutely gorgeous, the first time you see the city is very reminiscent of the first time you see Rapture in the original Bioshock (and also an obvious call-back to that famous scene, only the bathysphere is a rocket this time). Rapture also looks incredible in the Burial At Sea DLC.  Unfortunately, the game holds itself up considerably less well in terms of storyline and characters. Frankly, Father Comstock just isn't nearly as interesting a villain as Andrew Ryan, and the struggle between him and the Vox almost boring compared to the battle between Ryan and Atlas. In that regard, Fink feels like he would have made for a much better big bad. This becomes even more painfully obvious in Burial At Sea, when old characters make their returns. The Luteces, on the other hand, are absolutely brilliantly voiced by Courtnee Draper and Troy Baker as two bickering siblings, and the moments in the game where you encounter them are among my favourite.  I'm not going to say much about the ending to the main story. Yes, it sucks. As for the ending to Burial At Sea, well... That made a lot more sense, actually.  Altogether Bioshock Infinite is not a perfect game, but I had a LOT of fun playing it, and I fully recommend it and the Burial At Sea DLC.",1,0

6341647,8930,Sid Meier's Civilization V,"A few weeks ago i had a strange craving to play some 4X after years of mostly playing FPS and adventure games. To put it in context, the last 4X i played was Master of Orion. The original. After reading tons of reviews i decided Civ 5 was probably the best of the current generation. What can i say? It scratched the itch.  I haven't played any of the Civilizations since the original, so i don't know when all the new features came in, but i can say it's a worthy sequel. The hexagon view seems like a better way to split up the map, because it feels like your cities can be closer together. All the different terraforming options add a lot of flexibility over just irrigation vs mine. The music is very good. I absolutely love that both playthroughs i was able to win the game with cultural and diplomatic victories respectively, which is a massive improvement over the first Civ where you basically either had to nuke everyone or race to build a colony ship. And because of the way combat works now you don't even need to stack phalanxes all over the place. In fact as long as you stay peaceful you can get through the whole game with just a handful of units to patrol your borders. And, of course, you keep wanting 'just one more turn'.  Games like this have don't have much replay-factor for me because i prefer playing new games with new worlds to explore, but i'm happy to know this is in my collection for those weekends i feel like forgoing sleep to help a few scrappy settlers develop into a millenia-long dynasty.",1,0

Borderlands is extremly well-made, combines the feeling of a nice shooter with a story (which IS kinda flat, but still better than 90% of the shooters out there, and it isn't THAT bad - but Borderlands 2 is the better story game) which will give you tons of hours full of fun and many, many quests and challenges to complete.  Can it get even better, you ask? Well, listen here folks. 4 men co-pp experience! 4 men (or women)! You know what that means? Harder bosses, harder enemies in general, A LOT of better loot and probably the VERY BEST co-op experience you can obtain. For real. No other game will give you that much fun at some good evening with friends like Borderlands (maybe Gang Beasts will, it's pretty neat, but of course not comparable to a real co-op AAA experience). It's absurdly great.   Loot. Folks. LOOT. Prepare to jump around a rock or a house for at least 30 minutes wondering how to get on top of it because you can be sure there IS a lootchest and YOU WANT IT. Trust me, you do. That's the negative result of playing this hilarious game. In every other game which contains looting, you will see spots EVERYWHERE where you suspect a chest. Becuase that's how Borderlands is. There is loot EVERYWHERE. AND THAT'S GOOD.  The mixture of ActionRPG and shooter is good, you have many skills you can invest into, but it's still a good shooter with nice effects and many different enemies, which makes it good balanced in the first playthrough, NG+s are much easier, but I personally never played a game where this isn't the case.  And the best part: humour. It's funny as hell. Every boss has his mini intro with a cool and hilarious oneliners and also many ingame dialogs are freakin' funny. So many loveable and funny characters, you won't see this in any other game.   And last but not least: The 4 DLCs are really worth the money. Great stroy DLCs with MORE LOOT, MORE INSANE HUMOUR AND MORE STORY.  Get this game, learn to love it, be thankful to have played the very best coop and shooter experience you can get.",1,1

6359858,90200,Farming Simulator 2011,"The quality of human life depends on our living lives of purpose and meaning. Purpose and meaning must come from somewhere beyond – from our connectedness with “some higher order of things.” This “higher order” or “higher power” is the ultimate source of ethics and morality. A sustainable agriculture is built on an ethical foundation of friendship and stewardship – a more enlightened concept of self-interest.   Thus, the new American farmers, who are finding ways to farm more sustainably, are creating a metaphor of a more sustainable human society. As a society, we must stop exploiting our natural environment. We must look again to the timeless principle of diversity in finding new means of sustaining human progress.  I believe that we can, and must, help create a new kind of agriculture that will sustain a high “quality of life” for farmers and society, both for this generation and for all generations to come.

6364833,91700,E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy,"So let's try writing some review for these games I have. Anyways,  E.Y.E. You're a stupidly wierd game.  Good: The gameplay is fun for what it is, and I never got tired of the cool factor of being able to block machine gun fire with my sword or being able to hack into someone's skull to make them explode. Couple of other gadgets you start with too, and you have quite a few upgrades and new guns you can get that may or may not be fun to use. It never really gets painfully hard either, which I consider a redeeming factor for this incoherent game.  There are plenty of free missions and locales that you can play, several fun to use weapons, pyschic powers, a campaign that doesn't overstay it's welcome, and an awesome atmosphere that is both tense and unsettling. The entire setting has a nice cyberpunk feel to it, and there's plenty of cool factor to spare.  Bad: If you are expecting any kind of story to enjoy than good luck. Confusing English and a lack of explanation makes the story hard to follow at best. It doesn't help that the story plays with some insanity tropes as well; making things even more confusing. The rpg mechanics are worthless, and I never really felt like I became anything special aside from just a samurai guy. Some of the systems like magic/psychic power feels underdeveloped, and the insanity thing, which actually is an interesting mechanic for the game, can be removed by an 'upgrade'. As far as combat goes: the A.I. is ridiculous. One little detection can result in the entire enemy army walking in a straight line towards your location. There is also this weird critical hit/negative hit system, but I've killed enemies in one hit with a 'Failed Attack' several times so I don't know what to make of that. Overall, The whole thing just feels marred by poor design choices.  The story is confusing as a story can get. The core rpg mechanics lack complexity. There are way too dang many large empty areas. A.I. is clumsy at best. And you'll probably go through the whole game without buying or upgrading anything. Don't expect to be impressed anywhere here; there's just a lot of boring trash beneath a paper thin shine.  Overall: It's a game you have to play simply for the experience. Just to play for the overall unique strangeness of the setting. To get sucked in to the weirdness of the story about a cybernetic super samurai who may or may not be insane. It has it's cool moments to help things a long too, and to say again, you start with a sword that can block pretty much anything and sets people on fire.  But, if you are expecting a solid experience then you probably won't be amused by this at all. The game requires you to overlook a lot of problems. If it were even a little bit better I would change my overall opinion here. But there is just nothing to guarantee you will like this, so that's why I would not recommend it.",-1,1

6368437,91900,Post Apocalyptic Mayhem,"Gameplay is broken. Probably, bots were too slow to compete player in racing. So developers made that you don't need to race. In game where maps are racing circuits. Yet bots do race. Scoring are based on number of kills, and technically on number of laps completed, but latter has almost no impact on score. To win you just get away a bit, collect weapons and spam rear attack. Or don't try hard and just have a fun. And multiplayer is even worse. Most of weapons are made so you use while racing. But because there's no point in it, they can be simply avoided by slowing down. I don't say adding a real race mode would make this game better. As I said, player who got away at start will spam rear attacks and he will be unbeatable. And I didn’t even mention graphics or awful handling (most first person shooters have better car physics).  There is much better combat racing games on Steam. Head over to their direction. ",-1,0

'why is this game not embedded withing our gaming culture as one of the greats?' BECAUSE OF THE FREAKING ENDING!

Currently i have found 3 bosses so far:  -A big alien with a colossal amount of health  -A warrior dude that charges an insanely high damage instant beam that has no way to predict where it will go.  -A flying shaman that shoots homing explosive that does not get destroyed by touching enviroment, so it follows to you regardless of enviroment cover (you must shoot them and he shoots it so often when not using his special attack that you must use mostly the fast firing default), and a very short cooldown special attack that sucks everything around including the enviroment, the player and all bullet types, that shoots back at you after it finishes it.  -Final boss of the game was obnoxious, and actually easier than those flying shaman bosses. -Characters are bland and forgettable. -Storytelling was interesting but the story itself is bland and forgettable too.  +Enviroment visuals was really good and i had fun playing the levels where the objective was simply 'reach the exit'.  -All other levels sucked.

I learned a lesson there.  From the devs on their forums: 'Regarding gamepads - the game plays waaaay better with mouse/keyboard so we elected to not support gamepads.'  The lack of local co-op means you can only play multiplayer online, despite the original game being designed around having up to four players sitting around a TV at once. That feature is probably gone due to the PC version's controls. They added a keyboard+mouse control scheme, but completely removed any option to even use a gamepad.

Sure the graphics are obviously great but the 'arena shooter' elements aren't that good compared to past games that did it right, namely Quake 3 Arena and Unreal Tournament 2004. Guess Nexuiz is a b@stard child of Quake 3 vs UT2004.  Currently, I can't find myself to like Nexuiz. The weapons are uninspired, the maps are not memorable and very tiny 4vs4 arena. Since the game doesn't have a map editor, I bet MAP PACKS will be the CoD standard.  OVERALL: Nexuiz is a bland game with cool mutators that save's it from mediocrity. But you'd be better playing other alternatives instead which are far from lacking from F2P FPS games to older arena shooters like Quake 3, Quake Live and Unreal Tournament (any edition would do).

6398105,98200,Frozen Synapse,Frozen Synapse is a great time sink due to its well crafted and highly tactical gameplay and very well implemented multiplayer. A variety of modes and the ability to freely create your own skirmishes gives the package great replay value.,1,0

6405641,9900,Star Trek Online,"-Skip to bottom for summary of opinion or read on for major pros/cons-  Now i say i reccommend this game as a semi neutral due to the good and the bad nearly outweighing eachother. Iv put a ton more hours into this game than steam says as i used to play directly from the arc client. So iv seen a decent amount anyhow heres a list of my personal biggest pros n cons   Pros- Its star trek and frankly its pretty fun to go blowing up your enemys or vaporising them Voice acting is done by the original voice actors in many cases so + Cool looking ships both from the series/universe and new designs that generally fit in well   As someone who loves character customization theres enough to keep anyone entertained from creating people woth heads 5x their body or just making a cool looking character. A small tip for newbies choose the alein species you get to pick your species perks + have an extra perk, on top of that you get every customization option available and some even other playable species dont have so if u want a vulcan/human look you can get one thats 100% accurate. AKA you can basically change your species at will =P   Cons- Not all that ,any but some bugs that arent game brekaing but really waste your time -Missions not ending when they should ect BIGGEST CON the support sucks frankly if u get a glictch in a mission like u respawn in the wrong area and cant move on just beam out and restart that segment takes suppoet days usually. More of a pet peeve imo is that the best ships aka lvl 60 require the games p2w currency HOWEVER the p2w currency can be gotton with the f2p so if u play alot you can get it + the market is player driven so if you know what your doing you can merchant it and if you know exponential growth you can profit big time You can get stuck in areas of maps and the unstuck button will move you but you wont actually be moved out of the area/thing ur stuck in sometimes. The 3rd dimension of height is pretty much ignored aka you can only go up at a 45* angle and most space maps are rather flat   Summary- STO is a generally good game with from what iv seen a plethora of helpful players and a rather useless support system. Its free so honestly just get it no real risk if you dont like it if this was a paid game though frankly i personally would be on the fench myself and i love the game. End of the story get it try it if you dont like it delete it.",1,0
6407601,9900,Star Trek Online,"Not your typical MMO.   Been playing this game on and off since day 1, and its come a long way. The ground combat is more faster paced, the ship combat was always amazing, tech tree and economy streamlined, and the many ways you can customize your ship, character and crew is epic and enhances the journey you take in the games universe.   Pros: -Choose a base character race or create your own alien race (sadly has to be humanoid, but ive seen some pretty bizarre creations) - Customize your ship name, registration number, and crew names looks and appearance.  -go on in depth missions, voice acted by actors from the shows and films. -A custom mission editor which lets you make your own missions for other players to play. (Star Trek Fan Fiction Writers this ones for you.) -Free to Play! :D  Cons:  -Ground combat is still kinda repetitive and boring (they made it faster paced in 2011 with fps mode) -PVP is hard to get into, and when you do get into a match usually Federation side dominates.  -Only the hard line Star Trek Fans will probably appreciate this game. -Wallet Warrior/Pay to Win/Freemium Friendly.

6409714,99100,Dungeons & Dragons: Daggerdale,"Bland And Boring: Daggerfail is what they should've called this. There, I summed up the game in an amusing way, if I do say so myself (I'm hilarious, what can I say). Ok, let me explain some more. The graphics aren't that bad, but they ARE bland and the faces are ugly as hell. It's like I'm looking at people with down syndrome (no offense meant). Add some (and now I'm being generous) bugs and glitches and NO FUN whatsoever and this game is the result. I normally love dungeon crawlers, but the combat is clumsy, as well as the interface. The loot is crap. NPC's are (or get) stuck in environments and objects, (solved) quests aren't always triggered, the camera swirls around so much that it disorients me and I could go on and on and on. But it's just not worth it. Leave it be.  [Rating: 52/100]",-1,0
